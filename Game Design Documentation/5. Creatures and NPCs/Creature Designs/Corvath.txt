Defining Characteristics of the Corvath
The Corvath are descendants of Earth crows, having evolved unique adaptations and a complex society in Arathia. Standing at an average height of 5 feet, they are larger and more imposing than the Quarriel. Anatomically, they have converged on a similar body plan to the Quarriel, with winged arms ending in a thumb and single-digit hand. The Corvath are notorious for their pathological compulsion to steal, often hoarding valuable items and technology in their nests. This behavior creates significant conflict with other races, particularly the Quarriel.

Over time, this behavior became ingrained in their culture, shaping their interactions with other species and their role in the ecosystem. The Corvath's rich oral tradition emerged as a means of preserving and transmitting knowledge across generations, solidifying their identity and ensuring the continuity of their complex social structures.
