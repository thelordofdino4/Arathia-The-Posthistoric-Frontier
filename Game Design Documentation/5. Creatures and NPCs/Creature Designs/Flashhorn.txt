Detailed Description of the Flashhorn (Female)
Appearance:

Size: The female Flashhorn is a large creature, about the size of a gorilla.
Build: It has a robust, muscular build adapted for arboreal navigation.
Limbs: Six limbs, each ending in dexterous fingers for climbing and gripping tree branches.
Skin: Smooth with a mottled, marble-colored texture and very tiny tuberculate scales too small to see with the naked eye.
Head: Boxy head with oval eyes and a sudopupil that gives the illusion of tracking the observer due to light reflection on its compound eye lenses.
Antennae: Small horn-like sensory antennae protrude from the tip of its snout.
Armor: Bony plates along its back for added protection.
Behavior and Abilities:

Arboreal: Primarily navigates by climbing and jumping between trees, using its six limbs for excellent grip and balance.
Non-Hostile: Generally non-hostile towards the player, preferring to flee if attacked.
Defensive Mechanism: When threatened, it releases a volatile gas. If the Flashhorn strikes its horn-like antennae against the surface of its head, it produces a small flash that momentarily disorients the hunter.
Chance of Flash: While the females will probably run first, there is a small chance they will produce a flash.
Habitat:

Forests: The Flashhorn is commonly found in dense forest regions, where its climbing abilities and camouflage provide protection.
Tree Canopies: Often resides in the upper canopies, avoiding ground predators and utilizing the height for safety.
Interaction with the Player:

Non-Hostile Encounter: Players typically encounter female Flashhorns while exploring forests. They are non-hostile and will attempt to flee if approached too closely.
Resource Gathering: Hunting female Flashhorns can provide unique resources such as their volatile gas, antennae, and compound eyes, useful for crafting and alchemical purposes.
Challenges:

Flashbang Effect: The small flash can momentarily disorient players, making it difficult to pursue or capture the Flashhorn.
Arboreal Agility: Their ability to navigate through trees quickly makes them challenging to catch without careful planning.
Strategies for Hunting:

Stealth and Precision: Players must use stealth and precise timing to approach and capture Flashhorns without triggering their flashbang defense.
Traps: Setting traps in known travel paths can help in capturing Flashhorns.
Observation: Learning the Flashhornâ€™s behavior and movement patterns can provide opportunities for successful hunts.
Detailed Description of the Flashicorn (Male)
Appearance:

Size: The male Flashicorn is a much larger creature, about twice the size of the female, similar to a large bear.
Build: It has a robust, muscular build adapted for arboreal navigation and territorial defense.
Limbs: Six limbs, each ending in dexterous fingers for climbing and gripping tree branches.
Skin: Smooth with a mottled, marble-colored texture and very tiny tuberculate scales too small to see with the naked eye.
Head: Larger, boxy head with bigger oval eyes and a more pronounced sudopupil that gives the illusion of tracking the observer due to light reflection on its compound eye lenses.
Antennae: Larger horn-like sensory antennae protrude from the tip of its snout, used for defense.
Armor: Pronounced bony plates and spines along its back for added protection.
Behavior and Abilities:

Arboreal: Primarily navigates by climbing and jumping between trees, using its six limbs for excellent grip and balance.
Defensive and Territorial: Aggressive towards intruders, especially when defending its territory.
Defensive Mechanism: When threatened, it releases a volatile gas. If the Flashicorn strikes its horn-like antennae against the surface of its head, it produces a more powerful and blinding flash.
Aggressive Attacks: Prefers to stand its ground and attack using horn charges, slapping, body slams, and other physical attacks.
Horn Vulnerability: Breaking its horn stops it from being able to flash the hunter.
Habitat:

Forests: The Flashicorn is commonly found in dense forest regions, where its climbing abilities and territorial nature come into play.
Tree Canopies: Often resides in the upper canopies, utilizing height for surveillance and protection.
Interaction with the Player:

Territorial Encounter: Players encounter the Flashicorn as an early game boss, facing aggressive and defensive behaviors.
Resource Gathering: Defeating Flashicorns provides unique resources such as their volatile gas, larger antennae, and more durable compound eyes, useful for advanced crafting and alchemical purposes.
Challenges:

Flashbang Effect: The powerful blinding flash can severely disorient players, making it difficult to engage in combat.
Arboreal Agility and Strength: Their ability to navigate through trees quickly and their strength make them challenging to fight without careful planning.
Strategies for Hunting:

Preparation and Gear: Players must prepare with advanced gear and strategies to take on the Flashicorn effectively.
Traps and Tactics: Setting traps and using tactical maneuvers can help in weakening and defeating the Flashicorn.
Horn Vulnerability: Targeting and breaking its horn can neutralize its flashbang ability, making it easier to defeat.
Team Coordination: Coordinating with other players or NPCs can provide an advantage in taking down this powerful foe.
