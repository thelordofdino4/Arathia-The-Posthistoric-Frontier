Detailed Description of the Flashhorn
Appearance:

Size: The Flashhorn is a large creature, about the size of a gorilla.
Build: It has a robust, muscular build similar to a gorilla, adapted for arboreal navigation.
Limbs: Six limbs, each ending in dexterous fingers for climbing and gripping tree branches.
Skin: Smooth with a mottled, marble-colored texture and very tiny tuberculate scales too small to see with the naked eye.
Head: Boxy head with oval eyes and a sudopupil that gives the illusion of tracking the observer due to light reflection on its compound eye lenses.
Antennae: A small horn-like sensory antennae protrudes from the tip of its snout.
Armor: Bony plates along its back for added protection.
Behavior and Abilities:

Arboreal: Primarily navigates by climbing and jumping between trees, using its six limbs for excellent grip and balance.
Non-Hostile: Generally non-hostile towards the player, preferring to flee if attacked.
Defensive Mechanism: When threatened, it releases a volatile gas. If the Flashhorn strikes its horn-like antennae against the surface of its head, it produces a temporarily blinding flash.
Dominant Males: Larger members of the group, typically dominant males, will attempt to use the flashbang ability to protect the group and facilitate escape.
Habitat:

Forests: The Flashhorn is commonly found in dense forest regions, where its climbing abilities and camouflage provide protection.
Tree Canopies: Often resides in the upper canopies, avoiding ground predators and utilizing the height for safety.
Interaction with the Player:

Non-Hostile Encounter: Players typically encounter Flashhorns while exploring forests. They are non-hostile and will attempt to flee if approached too closely.
Defensive Flashbang: If attacked, dominant males may use their flashbang ability to temporarily blind the player, allowing the group to escape.
Resource Gathering: Hunting Flashhorns can provide unique resources such as their volatile gas, horn, and compound eyes, useful for crafting and alchemical purposes.
Challenges:

Flashbang Effect: The temporary blinding flash can disorient players, making it difficult to pursue or capture the Flashhorn.
Arboreal Agility: Their ability to navigate through trees quickly makes them challenging to catch without careful planning.
Strategies for Hunting:

Stealth and Precision: Players must use stealth and precise timing to approach and capture Flashhorns without triggering their flashbang defense.
Traps: Setting traps in known travel paths can help in capturing Flashhorns.
Observation: Learning the Flashhornâ€™s behavior and movement patterns can provide opportunities for successful hunts.
