# Maulcifer  
*Domustyrannus spoilator*  

## Overview  
Maulcifer (*Domustyrannus spoilator*) is a massive, bipedal apex predator from the dense forests of Arathia. Standing over two stories tall, this dragon-like creature is a fearsome presence, defined by its immense strength, resilience, and predatory instincts. Its territorial dominance and imposing physique make it a symbol of destruction and chaos, particularly for human settlements in Arathia. Maulcifer is infamous for having claimed and made its lair in a human-constructed mansion deep within the forest, forcing its original inhabitants to flee.  

## Appearance  
- **Size:** Maulcifer stands approximately 20-25 feet tall when upright and spans over 40 feet in length, including its powerful tail.  
- **Build:** Broad and muscular, with a prominent, rounded gut that belies its agility and power.  
- **Wings:** Small and vestigial compared to its body size, these wings are leathery and ridged, incapable of sustained flight but occasionally used for balance or intimidation displays.  
- **Scales:** Black with subtle red undertones and a gray underbelly. The scales vary in texture:  
  - **Ridges:** Pronounced along the back and limbs, providing protection.  
  - **Tuberculate Scales:** Flattened and rounded on the jaws, neck, belly, and undersides of limbs.  
- **Horns:** Two pairs of dragon-like horns:  
  - Primary horns curve outward from the crown of the skull, ridged and intimidating.  
  - Secondary horns protrude backward from the lower jaw, smaller but similarly ridged.  
- **Claws:** Long, sharp, and curved talons on both arms and feet, designed for gripping and tearing prey.  
- **Teeth:** Crocodile-like, constantly visible due to the structure of its jaws.  
- **Eyes:** Compound yet cat-like in appearance, fiery orange with a scintillating pattern of black geometric spots. The gem-like quality of its eyes enhances its predatory allure.  
- **Osteoderms:** Spiked bone-like structures adorn the hips, back, and forearms, offering additional defense.  

## Behavior  
- **Territorial Dominance:** Maulcifer is fiercely territorial, having claimed a human-built mansion as its domain. It patrols this area aggressively, attacking any intruders with calculated ferocity.  
- **Predatory Tactics:** While its size suggests a lumbering gait, Maulcifer is deceptively fast, using bursts of speed and powerful lunges to close the distance between itself and its prey.  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Hearing:** Its strongest sense, capable of detecting even the faintest disturbances.  
  - **Sight:** Keen at detecting movement, though not as effective for stationary prey.  
  - **Smell:** Highly developed, useful for tracking and detecting intruders.  
- **Resilience:** Maulcifer is exceptionally durable, with wounds closing quickly and a thick hide resistant to most forms of attack.  

## Combat Behavior  
- **Phase One:**  
  - Aggressively pursues intruders through the hallways of its lair, using its speed and strength to ambush prey.  
  - Can attack players on both floors of the mansion’s hall rooms, using its height to grab, flame, or swipe at targets on the upper balcony.  
  - Leaps between hallways to maintain pressure on its prey, moving unpredictably.  
- **Phase Two:**  
  - Once sufficiently weakened or sedated, Maulcifer’s mobility and dexterity decrease.  
  - Its room-filling flames are reduced to short bursts, and its lunges become sluggish and imprecise.  
  - Continues to swipe, stomp, and gore with its weight and claws, though these attacks lack the precision of the initial phase.  

## Ecology and Habitat  
- **Lair:**  
  The mansion Maulcifer resides in is a relic of early human settlement. After humans abandoned the structure due to Maulcifer’s siege, it became his permanent domain. The halls, filled with remnants of advanced technology, have been repurposed into his lair.  
- **Diet:**  
  Maulcifer is an opportunistic carnivore, preying on large creatures native to the forest. Its immense size requires significant caloric intake, supplemented by scavenging.  
- **Behavioral Notes:**  
  Despite its destructive tendencies, Maulcifer exhibits territorial consistency, rarely leaving the confines of the mansion and its immediate surroundings.
