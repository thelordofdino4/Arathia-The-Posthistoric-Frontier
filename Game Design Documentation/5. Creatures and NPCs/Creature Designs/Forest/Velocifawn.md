**Evolutionary History:**

The Velocifawn (Velocivenator cervus) is a unique creature that evolved from deer-like ancestors intentionally introduced to Arathia. These ancestors, originally small and agile herbivores, adapted to the dense forests and diverse ecosystems of their new environment. Over millions of years, the Velocifawn developed a lean, streamlined body for swift movement through the forest underbrush, similar to that of a terrestrial raptor. Their limbs became more powerful and flexible, allowing for rapid acceleration and agile maneuvers to escape predators. Additionally, their sensory capabilities, including keen eyesight and acute hearing, evolved to detect threats quickly. This combination of speed, agility, and heightened senses enabled the Velocifawn to thrive as a prey species, maintaining the balance of the forest ecosystem by grazing on vegetation and serving as a vital food source for predators.
