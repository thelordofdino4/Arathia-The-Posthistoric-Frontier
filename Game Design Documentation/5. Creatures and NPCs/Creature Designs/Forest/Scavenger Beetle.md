# Scavenger Beetle
*Necroceras vorax*

## Overview
The **Scavenger Beetle** is a large, robust creature that plays a crucial role in the forest ecosystem of Arathia by recycling nutrients from carcasses. It is uniquely adapted to detect and navigate complex environments, making its **Crystalline Eyes** a valuable resource for crafting gear designed to overcome camouflage and concealment.

## Appearance
- **Size**: The Scavenger Beetle measures around **6 feet in length** and stands **3 feet tall** at the thorax.
- **Exoskeleton and Endoskeleton**:
  - Features a hybrid of a **segmented exoskeleton** for protection and an internal endoskeleton for structural support.
- **Limbs**:
  - Has **10 limbs**, with two evolved into **elytra-like structures** to shield membranous wings. The remaining limbs are adapted for digging, grasping, and breaking down carrion.
- **Wings**:
  - Short, membranous wings adapted for powerful, short-distance flights.
- **Head**:
  - The head is shielded with armor extending to its mandibles, designed for tearing flesh and protecting vital sensory organs.
- **Antennae**:
  - Long, flexible antennae equipped with advanced sensory organs for detecting chemical and vibrational signals.
- **Crystalline Eyes**:
  - Vertebrate-like eyes made of highly reflective crystals, functioning without lenses or corneas. These eyes excel at focusing light onto photoreceptors, allowing the beetle to detect subtle environmental disturbances like shadows, vibrations, and minute optical distortions.

## Behavior and Ecology
1. **Scavenging**:
   - Feeds on dead organisms, breaking down carcasses to recycle nutrients into the ecosystem.
2. **Burrowing**:
   - Constructs burrows to hide from predators and create nests for laying eggs.
3. **Territoriality**:
   - While primarily non-aggressive, the beetle defends food sources and burrows against other scavengers.

## Crystalline Eyes and Their Unique Function
The **Crystalline Eyes** of the Scavenger Beetle are a marvel of evolutionary adaptation. Unlike conventional eyes, their crystalline structure focuses light directly onto photoreceptors, bypassing the need for lenses or corneas. This design offers several advantages:
1. **Enhanced Environmental Detection**:
   - The eyes are capable of perceiving subtle optical distortions, such as the faint outlines of objects or creatures blending into dense foliage.
   - The beetle uses this ability to locate carcasses hidden in vegetation or partially buried.

2. **Adaptation to Complex Environments**:
   - The eyes are highly sensitive to shifts in light and movement, making the beetle adept at navigating the intricate shadows and textures of the forest floor.
   
3. **Reflection and Focus**:
   - The crystalline structure of the eyes reflects and amplifies incoming light, allowing for exceptional clarity even in dim conditions.

## Use in Crafting: The Camouflage Denier
The **Crystalline Eyes** are a critical component of the **Camouflage Denier**, a piece of hunter gear designed to pierce through optical distortions. Their ability to detect camouflaged objects inspired hunters to incorporate the beetle’s natural adaptations into advanced eyewear. When paired with luminescent spores and a durable chitin frame, the Crystalline Eyes enable hunters to track even the stealthiest monsters through dense brush and camouflage zones.

---

## Habitat
- **Forest Regions**:
   - Commonly found in dense forests, where carrion is plentiful and the beetle’s camouflage detection abilities aid its scavenging.

---

## Reproduction
1. **Egg Laying**:
   - Females deposit eggs within decomposing carcasses, providing immediate nutrition for larvae upon hatching.
2. **Parental Care**:
   - Females occasionally guard their nests until the larvae emerge.

---

## Evolutionary History
1. **Origins**:
   - Descended from early arthropod-like creatures that adapted to the unique pressures of Arathia’s ecosystems.
2. **Unique Adaptations**:
   - Crystalline Eyes evolved to enhance the detection of subtle visual and vibrational cues, ensuring survival in competitive scavenger niches.
3. **Divergence**:
   - Belongs to the **Decapodiformes** phylum, known for combining exoskeletal protection with sensory sophistication.
