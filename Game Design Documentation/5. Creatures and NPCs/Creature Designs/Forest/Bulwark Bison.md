### Bulwark Bison (*Roosevellus scuticeros*)

The Bulwark Bison, *Roosevellus scuticeros*, is a massive herbivore native to the dense forests of Arathia. Descended from plains-dwelling bison species introduced to the planet by humans, this imposing creature has undergone significant adaptations to thrive in the challenging forest environment. Named for its distinctive defensive horns and formidable presence, the Bulwark Bison plays a critical role in its ecosystem as both a keystone herbivore and a competitor to the Frondgrazer (*Verdifera triplex*).

### Physical Description

- **Size:**
  - Height: Approximately 8 feet at the shoulder.
  - Length: 15 feet from nose to tail.
  - Weight: Up to 5 tons.

- **Horns:**
  - The Bulwark Bison’s horns are its most distinctive feature. These thick, forward-curving structures are adapted for pushing through dense vegetation and deflecting attacks from predators and hunters alike.
  - Covered in a keratinized outer layer and reinforced by a dense core, these horns are capable of withstanding significant impact. Their placement and curvature also allow them to redirect force away from the bison’s vulnerable head and neck.

- **Body:**
  - Its broad, muscular frame is covered in dense fur with a coarse texture, providing insulation and protection from the elements.
  - The fur’s coloration is a blend of dark browns and earthy tones, offering natural camouflage in the shadowy forest environment.

- **Hooves:**
  - Thick, padded hooves allow the Bulwark Bison to traverse uneven forest terrain with ease. The pads absorb shock, while their sharp edges provide traction on slippery or loose ground.

### Behavior and Ecology

- **Diet:**
  - The Bulwark Bison feeds on low-hanging branches, shrubs, and ground vegetation. Its powerful horns allow it to break through dense undergrowth to access food sources.
  - It also consumes nutrient-rich xenoplants from the Kingdom: Voltaplantae. These mineral-laden plants form an essential 35% of its diet, supporting its immense size and energy needs.

- **Social Structure:**
  - The Bulwark Bison lives in herds ranging from 10 to 30 individuals. These herds are matriarchal, led by an experienced female who guides the group through their territory.
  - While generally peaceful, herds will aggressively defend their members from predators and rival species, using their horns and sheer size as deterrents.

- **Habitat:**
  - Despite their plains-dwelling ancestry, Bulwark Bison have adapted to forest life by developing smaller, more compact herds and behaviors suited for navigating dense vegetation.
  - They rely on established trails within their territories to move efficiently through the forest and avoid becoming trapped in impassable undergrowth.

- **Predation and Defense:**
  - Adult Bulwark Bison have few natural predators due to their size and formidable defenses. However, young calves are vulnerable to larger carnivores like the Bloodmaw.
  - When threatened, the herd forms a defensive circle, with adults facing outward to protect their calves. Individual bison may charge attackers, using their horns to deadly effect.

### Competition with the Frondgrazer

The Bulwark Bison shares its habitat with the Frondgrazer (*Verdifera triplex*), leading to intense competition for resources.

- **Dietary Overlap:**
  - Both species feed on ground vegetation and low-hanging foliage, often targeting the same nutrient-rich plants. During droughts or lean seasons, this competition can escalate, with herds of both species clashing over limited resources.

- **Behavioral Differences:**
  - The Frondgrazer relies on its grasping fronds to pull down foliage and manipulate food, whereas the Bulwark Bison uses its brute strength and horns to access vegetation.
  - These differing strategies reduce direct competition in normal conditions but do not eliminate it entirely.

- **Conflict:**
  - Encounters between the two species are generally avoided, but when territory or food sources overlap, aggressive displays or direct confrontations can occur. The Bulwark Bison’s horns and larger size often give it an advantage in such disputes.
