# Maulcifer’s Domain

## Overview
Deep in Arathia’s forest lies a mansion built by early human settlers. Once a symbol of humanity’s ambition to carve out a home on this hostile planet, it now serves as the lair of Maulcifer—a two-story, rotund dragon that claimed the structure as his own. The mansion, equipped with sedative terminals to counter potential breaches, became a deathtrap when Maulcifer overran it. The remaining settlers fled, leaving behind valuable technology now guarded by the monstrous squatter.

Hunters must navigate the perilous halls of the mansion to subdue Maulcifer and recover the lost technology. This mission involves two distinct phases: a tense game of cat-and-mouse within the mansion halls, followed by a climactic battle in the central courtyard.

## Setting: The Mansion

### Architecture and History
The mansion was built during the early days of human settlement on Arathia, showcasing grand but practical design. Spacious halls, intricate woodwork, and reinforced walls were meant to withstand both Arathian weather and potential monster threats. However, Maulcifer’s unexpected takeover turned it into an abandoned ruin.

### Layout
- **Hall Rooms (12 Total):**
  Each of the 12 halls is two stories tall, with balconies on the second floor overlooking the ground floor. A circular layout connects the halls in a loop. Wide staircases link the two floors but are unusable by Maulcifer due to his massive size.
- **Side Rooms:**
  Small chambers branch off from the main halls, offering places for players to hide or evade Maulcifer’s attacks.
- **Central Courtyard:**
  An open area surrounded by the mansion, accessible only after Maulcifer breaks through the walls during the second phase.

### Atmosphere
The mansion is dimly lit, with scattered debris and signs of past human habitation. Hallways echo with Maulcifer’s heavy steps, guttural growls, and sudden roars, creating an ever-present sense of dread.

## Phase 1: The Hunt

### Objective
Activate 8 of the 12 sedative terminals scattered throughout the mansion to weaken Maulcifer, forcing him into the courtyard for the second phase.

### Mechanics
- **Terminal Activation:**
  Terminals are distributed across the two floors of the hall rooms. Activating a terminal requires careful timing and positioning, as Maulcifer’s presence can interrupt the process.
- **Maulcifer’s Behavior:**
  - **Roaming Threat:**  
    Maulcifer moves unpredictably between the halls, primarily patrolling the ground floor. His massive height allows him to interact with players on the second-floor balconies without climbing the stairs.
  - **Second-Floor Threats:**  
    Maulcifer can launch flame attacks, snap at players, or grab them from the ground floor if they linger near balcony edges.
  - **Leaping Between Halls:**  
    To maintain pressure on players, Maulcifer occasionally leaps between adjacent halls, creating a terrifying sense of unpredictability.
  - **Side Room Safety:**  
    Players can evade Maulcifer’s attacks by hiding in side rooms. However, he may swipe at or flame entrances if he suspects someone is inside.
- **Resistance to Sedation:**
  As more terminals are activated, Maulcifer becomes increasingly aggressive, roaring in defiance and speeding up his movements.
- **Camera Perspective:**
  - **Third-Person:** Used in the open halls to provide situational awareness.
  - **First-Person or Fixed Camera:** Activates in the narrow side rooms to intensify the claustrophobic atmosphere.

## Phase 2: The Confrontation

### Trigger
Once 8 terminals are activated, the sedative forces Maulcifer to retreat to the central courtyard. In a final display of fury, he breaks through a wall, allowing players to follow him into the open arena.

### Setting: Central Courtyard
The courtyard is overgrown with vegetation and strewn with remnants of the mansion’s construction. The open space provides opportunities for strategic positioning but also leaves players exposed to Maulcifer’s slower yet still devastating attacks.

### Mechanics
- **Weakened Maulcifer:**
  - The sedative dulls Maulcifer’s reactions, preventing him from using his deadliest abilities like room-clearing flames or grabs.
  - He moves more sluggishly but compensates with powerful sweeping attacks and flame bursts.
- **Combat Strategy:**
  - Players must exploit Maulcifer’s weakened state by targeting his underbelly and antennae horns.
  - The environment offers limited cover and opportunities to stagger him with well-timed strikes.
- **Victory Condition:**
  Defeat Maulcifer in direct combat to recover the lost human technology.

## Lore Integration
- **Maulcifer’s Arrival:**
  The mansion was abandoned early in humanity’s settlement of Arathia after Maulcifer claimed it as his lair. His overwhelming strength and resistance to the sedative systems forced settlers to flee, leaving their technology behind.
- **The Technology:**
  Locked within the mansion is a key piece of early human innovation—an artifact critical for advancing settlement defenses. Recovering it is a matter of survival for humanity on Arathia.
- **Maulcifer’s Nature:**
  Maulcifer is no ancient guardian or mystical entity. He is a powerful, territorial monster who found the mansion and made it his domain, drawn by the warmth and security of its walls.
