# Bastion Avaris: A Description of the Mansion and its Ruins

## Overview
Bastion Avaris, once a symbol of human ingenuity and defiance against the untamed wilderness of Arathia, now stands as a haunting monument to hubris and devastation. Built deep within the uncharted forests, the mansion was designed as a self-sufficient sanctuary for humanity's wealthiest pioneers, equipped with cutting-edge technology and luxurious accommodations. In its current state, however, Avaris is a crumbling ruin, overshadowed by the presence of its monstrous occupant, Maulcifer.

## Original Design and Purpose
Bastion Avaris was constructed with grandeur in mind, its architecture blending Earth-inspired neoclassical aesthetics with Arathian materials. The mansion featured alabaster walls, towering columns, and expansive windows that allowed sunlight to flood the opulent halls. Every element of its design emphasized wealth, security, and self-reliance, boasting advanced defense systems, automated amenities, and redundant energy sources.

At its core, the mansion's layout was built around a central courtyard. Encircling this courtyard were twelve interconnected hall rooms, arranged in a perfect square perimeter. The grand atrium, serving as both the main entrance and the centerpiece of its opulence, was positioned at the forefront of the estate.

## Current State
Years after Maulcifer’s takeover, Bastion Avaris is an eerie ruin. The once-vibrant mansion is now cloaked in shadow, its alabaster walls blackened by fire and clawed into jagged scars. The central courtyard, encircled by shattered hall rooms, is overrun with vegetation and Maulcifer’s imposing presence.

### Notable Features
1. **Grand Atrium:** Once the mansion's welcoming point and central hub of activity, the grand atrium now serves as a makeshift base camp for hunters venturing into the quest to challenge Maulcifer. The space retains its grandeur, with high ceilings and remnants of the elaborate staircase leading to the second floor. Its current state reflects years of neglect, with cracks and scorch marks tarnishing its former beauty.

2. **Central Courtyard:** The courtyard, located at the very heart of Avaris, was originally designed as a serene garden oasis. Surrounded by towering hall rooms, it was filled with exotic Earth flora, brought from humanity’s homeworld. Now overrun by Arathian vegetation, the courtyard serves as the final arena for Maulcifer, where his power and ferocity are at their most dangerous.

3. **Encircling Hall Rooms:** The twelve interconnected hall rooms encircle the central courtyard, creating a square path spanning two stories tall. These halls were multifunctional spaces, housing libraries, galleries, and lounges. In their ruined state, they are scarred with claw marks and filled with debris. Each hall features staircases connecting the first and second floors, allowing hunters to navigate strategically to avoid Maulcifer’s wrath.

4. **Side Rooms:** Branching off from the main hallways, these smaller chambers were once private studies, storerooms, and servant quarters. Now, they serve as potential hiding spots for hunters evading Maulcifer’s pursuit.

5. **Observation Tower:** Positioned at the rear of the mansion, the observation tower provided panoramic views of the surrounding forest. Now partially collapsed, its base remains intact, acting as a perch for Maulcifer when he retreats to survey his domain.

6. **Sedative Dispenser Terminals:** Distributed throughout the hall rooms and central areas, these devices were designed to pacify attacking megafauna. While effective in slowing Maulcifer, they ultimately failed to subdue him during his initial assault. The terminals still function intermittently, providing hunters a key strategy in the quest to neutralize the beast.

### Notable Landmarks
- **Shattered Solar Gallery:** A glass-ceilinged hall lined with solar panels and intricate stained-glass artwork depicting Earth’s history. Most of the panels are shattered, with broken glass crunching underfoot as Maulcifer patrols nearby.
- **The Fallen Chandelier:** In the dining hall, an enormous crystal chandelier lies shattered on the floor. Its jagged pieces scatter light eerily in the dim halls, and its sheer size speaks to the mansion’s former opulence.
- **The Library of Echoes:** A massive, two-story library where bookshelves now lie toppled, and ancient Earth literature mingles with Arathian flora creeping in through broken windows. Maulcifer often pauses here to rest, making it a perilous area for hunters.
- **The Arboretum Wing:** Once a lush indoor garden filled with Earth plants sustained by advanced climate control, it is now overrun with aggressive native flora. Hunters may find medicinal herbs or rare materials here, though the environment is hostile.
- **The Master’s Vault:** A secure room said to contain the most valuable technology left by the mansion’s original owners. Its reinforced door remains intact, a tantalizing reward for those daring enough to face Maulcifer.

## Legacy
Bastion Avaris is more than a ruin; it is a stark reminder of the arrogance of humanity’s early settlers. The mansion’s remaining technology, buried within its walls, has the potential to revolutionize human expansion on Arathia. However, retrieving it means braving Maulcifer’s domain—a task few are willing to undertake.

The mansion stands as a warning to all who dare underestimate the wilderness of Arathia. Its crumbled halls and overrun courtyard tell a story of ambition, devastation, and the indomitable force of nature reclaiming what was never truly conquered.


# Quest Overview: Bastion Avaris Encounter

## Mission Premise

Bastion Avaris, a sprawling mansion lost to Maulcifer’s dominance, houses a vital artifact critical for humanity’s expansion on Arathia. Hunters are tasked with navigating the perilous halls of the ruined estate, using the remaining sedative terminals to weaken the monstrous squatter, Maulcifer. Success hinges on strategic exploration, evasion, and combat mastery in two distinct phases.

---

## Phase 1: The Hunt

### Objective
Activate 8 of the 12 sedative terminals spread across the two floors of Bastion Avaris. These terminals are critical to weakening Maulcifer and forcing him into the central courtyard for a final confrontation.

### Mechanics
- **Terminal Activation:**  
  Strategically placed terminals require players to locate and interact with them while evading Maulcifer’s pursuit. Interaction is brief but leaves players vulnerable.  
- **Maulcifer’s Behavior:**  
  - **Dynamic Patrols:** Maulcifer roams unpredictably across the halls, leaping between sections to maintain pressure on the player.  
  - **Heightened Threats:** From the ground floor, Maulcifer can attack players on the second-floor balconies with flame breaths, grabs, or swipes.  
  - **Side Room Safety:** Temporary reprieves can be found in side rooms, but Maulcifer may investigate suspicious noises, forcing players to keep moving.  
- **Escalation:**  
  As more terminals are activated, Maulcifer grows more aggressive, moving faster and roaring to disrupt player focus.  
- **Camera Perspective:**  
  - **Third-Person:** Dominates the hallways to provide awareness of Maulcifer’s patrols.  
  - **First-Person or Fixed Camera:** Engages in side rooms to heighten suspense and intensify confined encounters.

## Phase 2: The Confrontation

### Trigger
Once 8 terminals are successfully activated, Maulcifer is forced into the central courtyard, weakened by the sedative. He breaks through the mansion walls, initiating the final phase of the mission.

### Mechanics
- **Weakened Abilities:**  
  - Maulcifer’s fire breath is reduced to a short, less frequent cone.  
  - Grab and throw attacks are disabled due to his reduced dexterity.  
  - He moves slower but retains devastating swipes, tail smashes, and charges.  
- **Combat Strategy:**  
  Players must exploit Maulcifer’s dulled reflexes by targeting his vulnerable underbelly and antennae horns.  
  - **Environmental Hazards:** Limited cover and the overgrown courtyard terrain introduce additional challenges.  
- **Victory Condition:**  
  Defeat Maulcifer in direct combat to recover the lost artifact hidden within Bastion Avaris.

## Lore Integration
- **Sedative Terminals:** Designed as a failsafe for megafauna breaches, the mansion’s sedative systems became the settlers’ last hope during Maulcifer’s siege. While effective at slowing him, they ultimately failed to neutralize the beast.  
- **Technological Artifact:** A relic of early human ingenuity lies within the mansion’s vault, capable of revolutionizing settlement defenses. Recovering this artifact is essential for humanity’s survival in the hostile wilderness of Arathia.  
- **Maulcifer’s Occupation:** Maulcifer claimed Bastion Avaris as his lair after overwhelming its defenses. His presence serves as a grim reminder of humanity’s hubris and the dangers of Arathia’s untamed wilderness.

## Rewards
1. **Maulcifer Materials:**  
   - Unique crafting components for gear with enhanced fire resistance, durability, and strength.  
2. **Artifact Recovery:**  
   - Unlocks advanced human technology, aiding in settlement expansion and defense.  
3. **Achievement:**  
   - A prestigious title marking the player’s survival and triumph over Maulcifer.

## Unique Elements
This mission balances high-stakes evasion with strategic combat. Phase 1 focuses on cat-and-mouse gameplay within the interconnected halls, while Phase 2 transitions into an epic battle in the courtyard. The shifting dynamics and atmospheric tension of the mansion’s ruined state make this encounter one of Arathia’s most memorable and challenging hunts.
