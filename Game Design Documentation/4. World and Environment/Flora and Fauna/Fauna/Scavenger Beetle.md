# Scavenger Beetle
<details>
<summary><strong>Scavenger Beetle Information</strong></summary>
The Scavenger Beetle (Necroceras vorax) is a large, robust creature that plays a crucial role in the forest ecosystem of Arathia by recycling nutrients from carcasses. Belonging to a distinct phylum, this beetle exhibits unique anatomical and physiological traits that set it apart from Earth analogues.

***

**Appearance:**

* **Size:** The Scavenger Beetle is a large creature, measuring around 6 feet in length and standing 3 feet tall at the thorax.
* **Exoskeleton and Endoskeleton:** It possesses both an exoskeleton and endoskeleton, providing it with exceptional strength and durability. The exoskeleton is tough and segmented, offering protection and flexibility.
* **Limbs:** The Scavenger Beetle has 10 limbs. Two of these limbs have evolved into elytra-like structures that protect the membranous wings underneath. The remaining limbs are sturdy and adapted for digging, grasping, and manipulating carrion.
* **Wings:** Underneath the elytra are membranous wings, adapted for short, powerful flights. These wings evolved through a unique evolutionary path, featuring specialized structures that allow for efficient movement and durability.
* **Head:** Its head is covered with a protective shield that extends down to the mandibles, providing armor while allowing for powerful bites. The jaws are boxy with a distinct chin, and triangular teeth are present on the outside of its mouth, designed for tearing flesh.
* **Antennae:** Long, flexible antennae are present, equipped with sensory organs for detecting chemicals and vibrations in the environment.
* **Eyes:** The Scavenger Beetle has vertebrate-like eyes with pinholes that provide fine directional sensitivity. These eyes are made of crystal that focuses light onto photoreceptors, eliminating the need for a lens and cornea.

**Behavior and Ecology:**

* **Scavenging:** The Scavenger Beetle primarily feeds on dead organisms, playing a vital role in decomposing and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. It is attracted to the scent of decay and uses its powerful jaws to break down carcasses.
* **Burrowing:** Equipped with strong limbs, the Scavenger Beetle can burrow into the ground to hide from predators and create nests for laying eggs.
* **Territoriality:** While generally non-aggressive, the Scavenger Beetle will defend its food sources from other scavengers and predators.

***

**Habitat:**

* **Forest Regions:** The Scavenger Beetle is commonly found in dense forests, where it can find ample carrion and organic material to feed on.
* **Nesting:** It creates burrows and nests in the forest floor, where it lays eggs and rears its young in a protected environment.

***

**Reproduction:**

* **Egg Laying:** Females lay eggs in concealed nests, often within decomposing carcasses to provide immediate food for the larvae upon hatching.
* **Parental Care:** While primarily solitary, females may guard their nests until the eggs hatch, ensuring the survival of the next generation.

**Evolutionary History:**

* **Origins:** The Scavenger Beetle evolved from early arthropod-like ancestors that adapted to the unique environmental pressures of Arathia. Over millions of years, these creatures developed a combination of exoskeleton and endoskeleton, enhancing their strength and durability.
* **Adaptations:** The development of crystalline eyes allowed for better visual acuity, while the evolution of elytra-like structures provided protection for the delicate wings underneath. The unique jaw structure evolved to efficiently process carrion, ensuring the beetle's role as a primary decomposer in the ecosystem.
* **Divergence:** The Decapodiformes phylum saw the emergence of two main clades: Thoracica, with distinct abdomen and thorax, and Cephalothoracica, with a fused cephalothorax. This divergence allowed for a wide range of ecological niches to be occupied by related species.
