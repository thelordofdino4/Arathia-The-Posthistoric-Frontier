Prologue
Millions of years ago, humans from Earth sought to escape their dying planet by seeding Arathia, a distant world they believed to be uninhabited. However, Arathia was already home to diverse and evolving life forms. Due to a cosmic anomaly and time dilation, humans only returned to Arathia after what seemed like a thousand years to them but was actually 15 million years on Arathia.

Act 1: Awakening
Awakening: The protagonist begins their journey by stepping out of their home, fifty years after the initial crash landing. They step outside, introducing the player to the new world and the settlement where the protagonist lives.
Settlement Introduction: The player explores the settlement, meeting other humans and learning about the daily life and challenges faced by the community.
Initial Quests: The protagonist takes on basic tasks to help the settlement, such as gathering resources and hunting small creatures, allowing the player to familiarize themselves with the game mechanics.
Discovery: As the protagonist becomes more educated about the local wildlife, monsters, and people, they learn new things about the planet's ecosystem and their part in it. This includes discoveries about the basic and advanced biology of Earth's invasive life and the native life on the planet.
Established Harmony: Despite initial conflicts, the four sentient species—humans, Arak'rii, Quarriel, and Ferloth—now live in relative harmony. While some distrust still exists, cooperation and mutual respect have become the norm.

Act 2: Building Alliances
Strengthening Bonds: The protagonist works to strengthen alliances with native species, participating in joint activities and resolving conflicts.
Learning and Training: The protagonist masters new hunting techniques and weapons crafted with hybrid technologies.
First Major Challenge: During a routine quest to gather essential resources, the protagonist encounters their first significant obstacle—a monstrous creature evolved from Earth's invasive life. This mammalian predator is capable of flight, immensely strong, and far too powerful for the hunter to defeat with their current gear.
Avoidance and Strategy: The hunter must carefully avoid the creature while gathering the necessary resources, learning to use stealth and strategic planning to complete the quest.
Gear Upgrades: Realizing the need for better equipment, the protagonist seeks to upgrade their gear, prompting new quests to find rare materials and learn advanced crafting techniques.
Ecological Disturbances: It is initially believed that this monstrous creature is causing massive ecological disturbances, pushing dangerous monsters from their territories and threatening the settlement.
Building Defenses: Seeing the need to protect their settlement, the Arak'rii task the hunter to build defenses and send them on tasks that require gathering resources and hunting monsters to complete the challenge.
Benefits of Hunting: Using the gear made from slaying these creatures allows new armor, weapons, and items to be crafted, aiding the hunter in future battles.

Act 3: Facing Threats
Monstrous Threats: The protagonist faces increasingly dangerous creatures that threaten human and native settlements.
Ecological Challenges: Players address ecological disruptions caused by invasive species, restoring balance to Arathia's ecosystems.
Unlocking the Story: As the protagonist unlocks more challenging fights, new pieces of the story are revealed. Players learn about:
Pre-Human Relations: The history of interactions among the four sentient species before humans arrived on Arathia.
Lost Civilization: Discoveries related to an ancient, lost civilization that once thrived on Arathia, providing context and lore.
Antagonistic Factions: The protagonist encounters antagonistic factions that challenge the native species:
Crow-like Species: Descendants of Earth, these intelligent and cunning creatures challenge the Quarriel.
Rat-like Species: A highly adaptive and resourceful species that pose a threat to the Ferloth.
Heavily Armored Species: Almost demonic in appearance, these formidable beings challenge the Arak'rii.
Building Relations: Establishing relations with these antagonistic factions is crucial. By doing so, the player can:
Gaining Allies: Unlock benefits such as having these factions aid in monster slaying and capture during quests.
Accessing New Areas: Unlock previously inaccessible areas on maps, providing opportunities for further exploration and resource gathering.
Protecting the Settlement: As the ecological balance is disturbed, more dangerous monsters encroach upon the human and native settlements. The protagonist must use their upgraded gear and newfound skills to fend off these threats and protect their home.
Cultural Integration: Humans and native species work together, sharing knowledge and technology to build a more resilient society.
Strategic Defense: The Arak'rii provide strategic guidance, helping the protagonist and other hunters set up traps, fortifications, and defensive measures to safeguard the settlements.

Act 4: The Great Cataclysm
Final Preparation: The protagonist is finally ready to face the predator that caught them off guard in Act 2. They prepare new armor and weapons, build defensive structures around the settlement, and secure aid from the conflicting factions.
The Battle: The quest involves drawing the predator to the settlement in a high-stakes battle. Guns, cannons, and defensive barriers are erected, trapping the monster in an arena with the hunter. After a fierce battle, the predator is defeated.
Celebration and Calamity: The village celebrates the victory, but the land shakes as a volcano erupts. The cause of the eruption is not geologic but the awakening of an ancient behemoth beneath the land.
Revealing the Threat: The Arak'rii inform the player that if the behemoth is not slain, it will cause a localized mass extinction, threatening all life. This creature is a native Lithocellata refined by 15 million years of strife.
Hope Against Despair: Initially, hope is lost, but the protagonist insists they are up to the task. The Arak'rii put the player through a series of trials before agreeing that they are the only one who can destroy the monster.
Learning from the Past: During the trials, more information about the lost civilization, their tools, and how they died off (at the hands of the same monster) is revealed. The player learns from their mistakes and crafts a final new weapon type ideally suited to vanquishing the creature (this weapon is not required to fight the final boss of the main story).
Trials and Training: The trials involve various tasks, including fighting smaller but similarly formidable creatures, gathering rare materials, and mastering new techniques that will be essential in the final battle.
Final Preparation: With the knowledge and new weapon, the protagonist is now ready to face the ancient behemoth.

Act 5: The Final Hunt
Hunting the Behemoth: The protagonist hunts the ancient behemoth, a dragon that makes its home in active volcanic flows beneath the surface of the planet. It is currently transitioning from a larval stage to a juvenile stage, a violent process that pulls in massive amounts of geological energy, causing volcanic eruptions as it moves through the earth.
High-Stakes Battle: The hunter catches up with the monster as it is about to take flight, which would awaken a supervolcano on the continent leading to mass extinction.
Repel or Slay: The protagonist has two options:
Repel: If the creature is successfully repelled, it will dive deeper into the earth, taking the geological activity away from the area.
Slay: If it is slain, the result is similar, but it unlocks a new area for the player to take quests in.
Legacy of the Hunter: Defeating or repelling the ancient behemoth solidifies the protagonist's legacy as the greatest hunter, ensuring the survival and prosperity of their community and allies.
Epilogue
Harmony Restored: With the ancient behemoth defeated or repelled, the immediate threat to the continent is neutralized. Humans and native species continue to coexist, sharing a future built on mutual respect and cooperation.
New Horizons: The new area unlocked by slaying the behemoth opens up further exploration and opportunities for the player to continue their adventures.
Continuing Adventures: The game world remains open for exploration and new quests, allowing players to uncover more secrets, build stronger alliances, and face new challenges.
