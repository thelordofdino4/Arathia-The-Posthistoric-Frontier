# Quest Overview: Bastion Avaris Encounter

## Mission Premise

Bastion Avaris, a sprawling mansion lost to Maulcifer’s dominance, houses a vital artifact critical for humanity’s expansion on Arathia. Hunters are tasked with navigating the perilous halls of the ruined estate, using the remaining sedative terminals to weaken the monstrous squatter, Maulcifer. Success hinges on strategic exploration, evasion, and combat mastery in two distinct phases.

## Phase 1: The Hunt

### Objective
Activate 8 of the 12 sedative terminals spread across the two floors of Bastion Avaris. These terminals are critical to weakening Maulcifer and forcing him into the central courtyard for a final confrontation.

### Mechanics
- **Terminal Activation:**  
  Strategically placed terminals require players to locate and interact with them while evading Maulcifer’s pursuit. Interaction is brief but leaves players vulnerable.  
- **Maulcifer’s Behavior:**  
  - **Dynamic Patrols:** Maulcifer roams unpredictably across the halls, leaping between sections to maintain pressure on the player.  
  - **Heightened Threats:** From the ground floor, Maulcifer can attack players on the second-floor balconies with flame breaths, grabs, or swipes.  
  - **Side Room Safety:** Temporary reprieves can be found in side rooms, but Maulcifer may investigate suspicious noises, forcing players to keep moving.  
- **Escalation:**  
  As more terminals are activated, Maulcifer grows more aggressive, moving faster and roaring to disrupt player focus.  
- **Camera Perspective:**  
  - **Third-Person:** Dominates the hallways to provide awareness of Maulcifer’s patrols.  
  - **First-Person or Fixed Camera:** Engages in side rooms to heighten suspense and intensify confined encounters.

## Phase 2: The Confrontation

### Trigger
Once 8 terminals are successfully activated, Maulcifer is forced into the central courtyard, weakened by the sedative. He breaks through the mansion walls, initiating the final phase of the mission.

### Mechanics
- **Weakened Abilities:**  
  - Maulcifer’s fire breath is reduced to a short, less frequent cone.  
  - Grab and throw attacks are disabled due to his reduced dexterity.  
  - He moves slower but retains devastating swipes, tail smashes, and charges.  
- **Combat Strategy:**  
  Players must exploit Maulcifer’s dulled reflexes by targeting his vulnerable underbelly and antennae horns.  
  - **Environmental Hazards:** Limited cover and the overgrown courtyard terrain introduce additional challenges.  
- **Victory Condition:**  
  Defeat Maulcifer in direct combat to recover the lost artifact hidden within Bastion Avaris.

## Lore Integration
- **Sedative Terminals:** Designed as a failsafe for megafauna breaches, the mansion’s sedative systems became the settlers’ last hope during Maulcifer’s siege. While effective at slowing him, they ultimately failed to neutralize the beast.  
- **Technological Artifact:** A relic of early human ingenuity lies within the mansion’s vault, capable of revolutionizing settlement defenses. Recovering this artifact is essential for humanity’s survival in the hostile wilderness of Arathia.  
- **Maulcifer’s Occupation:** Maulcifer claimed Bastion Avaris as his lair after overwhelming its defenses. His presence serves as a grim reminder of humanity’s hubris and the dangers of Arathia’s untamed wilderness.

2. **Artifact Recovery:**

3. **Achievement:**  
   - A prestigious title marking the player’s survival and triumph over Maulcifer.

## Unique Elements
This mission balances high-stakes evasion with strategic combat. Phase 1 focuses on cat-and-mouse gameplay within the interconnected halls, while Phase 2 transitions into an epic battle in the courtyard. The shifting dynamics and atmospheric tension of the mansion’s ruined state make this encounter one of Arathia’s most memorable and challenging hunts.
