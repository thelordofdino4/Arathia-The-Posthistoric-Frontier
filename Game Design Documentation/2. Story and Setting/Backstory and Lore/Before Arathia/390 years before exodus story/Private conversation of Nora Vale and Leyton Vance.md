# 383 Years Before Project Exodus: A Private Conversation Between Nora Vale and Leyton Vance  

---

## **Setting**  
**Location:** A secluded chamber in a secure deep state facility.  
**Participants:**  
- **Chairman Nora Vale:** Leader of the deep state, a pragmatic but deeply disillusioned figure.  
- **Admiral Leyton Vance:** Military liaison to the deep state, hardened and deeply invested in humanity’s survival.  

*(The room is dimly lit, its sparse furnishings emphasizing function over form. The soundproof walls create an atmosphere of oppressive silence. Chairman Nora Vale pours herself a drink as Admiral Leyton Vance enters, his uniform immaculate but his face lined with fatigue.)*

### **Transcript of Conversation**  

**Chairman Nora Vale:**  
*(Gesturing to a chair)* "Leyton, sit. You look like hell."  

**Admiral Leyton Vance:**  
*(Grimacing as he sits)* "You’re one to talk, Nora. How long has it been since either of us got a decent night’s sleep?"  

**Vale:**  
"Too long. These days, I’m not sure it would help. Every time I close my eyes, all I see is... this."  

*(She waves her hand vaguely, as if encompassing the entire world’s misery.)*  

**Vance:**  
"Join the club. It’s a wonder anyone shows up to these meetings anymore. Most of the old guard are gone—retired, dead, or just disappeared. Sometimes I wonder if we’re fools for staying."  

**Vale:**  
*(Sighs, taking a sip of her drink)* "Fools or cowards, take your pick. At least we’re still here, trying to hold this mess together. Not that it seems to be working."  

*(She stares into her glass for a moment, her voice softening.)*  

"Do you ever think about what it was like when this started, Leyton? Back when we still believed we could fix things?"  

**Vance:**  
*(Leaning back, his expression darkening)* "Every damn day. We had a chance, didn’t we? A real shot at turning this around. Now... the world’s worse off than it was when we began. Mars is collapsing under its own weight, the Belt’s a powder keg, and Earth—"  

**Vale:**  
"Earth is dying. We’ve been trying to resuscitate a corpse, and we both know it."

### **The Conversation Turns to Victor Harlan**  

**Vance:**  
"And then there’s Victor. That smug bastard and his empire of lies. TerraGene was supposed to be a lifeline, a way to stabilize the ERI and give humanity a chance. Instead, it’s just another corporation bleeding the world dry."  

**Vale:**  
*(Her tone sharpens, anger flashing in her eyes)* "I’ve had enough of him. His constant lies, his false promises—he’s out of control. Every year, TerraGene falls further out of compliance, and every year, we let him get away with it."  

**Vance:**  
"He’s not the only one, but he’s the worst. The others follow his lead because he makes it look easy—profiting off destruction while spinning it as salvation."  

**Vale:**  
*(Her voice drops, cold and deliberate)* "Victor Harlan is a cancer. And cancers have to be cut out."  

**Vance:**  
*(Nods slowly)* "We’ve been talking about this for years, Nora. What’s stopping us?"  

**Vale:**  
"Timing. We need something big—something we can use to distract Earth and Mars when Victor disappears from the stage. If we move too soon, it’ll just look like another power play, and the fallout will be worse than keeping him around."  

**Vance:**  
*(Leaning forward, his tone dark)* "You’re saying we wait for a crisis. Something inevitable, given the way things are going."  

**Vale:**  
*(Nods)* "Exactly. Mars’ population is on the brink of collapse, the Belt’s factions are constantly at each other’s throats, and Earth... Well, Earth is always teetering. When the next big event hits, we strike. Victor goes away, and the world’s attention shifts to the new disaster."  

**Vance:**  
"And then what? Another corporate puppet takes his place?"  

**Vale:**  
"Not if we plan this right. I’ve been keeping an eye on Elias Cormack. He’s ambitious but pragmatic. He understands the stakes, and unlike Victor, I think he might actually care about fixing things—if only to save his own skin."  

**Vance:**  
"Cormack’s no saint, but he’s better than Harlan. He might even make a decent scapegoat if things go south."

### **Frustration and Resignation**  

**Vale:**  
*(Sighing heavily, finishing her drink)* "I’m so damn tired, Leyton. Tired of the lies, the greed, the constant uphill battle. We’ve spent our lives trying to fix this mess, and what do we have to show for it? A planet that’s barely habitable, colonies on the verge of collapse, and people like Victor making things worse at every turn."  

**Vance:**  
*(His voice softens)* "We’ve kept the world from falling apart completely. That has to count for something, doesn’t it?"  

**Vale:**  
*(Staring at him, her expression weary but resolute)* "Not if it’s all for nothing. If we don’t act soon, Leyton, there won’t be anything left to save."  

*(She sets her glass down with a sharp clink, her tone turning firm.)*  

"When the time comes, we deal with Victor. No hesitation, no second-guessing. Agreed?"  

**Vance:**  
*(After a long pause, he nods)* "Agreed."

- **Lingering Doubts**: Both leaders wrestled with the moral compromises they had made, but their frustration and weariness drove them forward.  
- **The Rise of Elias Cormack**: Vale’s mention of Elias Cormack foreshadowed his eventual promotion to CEO of TerraGene, where he would attempt to undo the damage wrought by Harlan.
