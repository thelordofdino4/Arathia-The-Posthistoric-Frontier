# 390 Years Before Project Exodus: Population Collapse  

---

## **The Great Decline**  

390 years before Project Exodus, Earth’s population plummeted to 2.4 billion—a catastrophic drop from the 7 billion that had lived on the planet just a few centuries prior. This era, known as **The Great Decline**, marked the unraveling of human civilization as famine, ecological disasters, and violent conflicts over dwindling resources swept the globe.

## **Famine and Resource Wars**

### **Collapse of Global Agriculture**
The global food supply chain, already weakened by climate change and soil degradation, reached a breaking point. Rising temperatures, erratic weather patterns, and the loss of fertile land left entire regions unable to sustain agriculture. Key agricultural centers like the American Midwest, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa turned into arid wastelands.  

Without sufficient crops to feed the remaining population, famine became widespread:  
- **Mass Starvation**: Millions perished as staple crops like wheat, rice, and corn failed to grow.  
- **Food Hoarding and Black Markets**: Wealthy nations and corporations stockpiled resources, exacerbating global inequalities and sparking resentment.  

### **Conflict Over Scarcity**
As famine spread, competition for resources ignited violent conflicts across the world:  
- **Water Wars**: Rivers like the Nile, Ganges, and Colorado dried to dangerous levels, spurring armed conflicts between nations and communities.  
- **Energy Conflicts**: Oil and natural gas reserves became strategic flashpoints, with nations militarizing extraction sites to control dwindling supplies.  
- **Internal Strife**: Governments fractured under the strain, leading to civil wars and the rise of warlords controlling pockets of resources.

## **Ecological Disasters**

### **Frequency and Intensity**
Natural disasters increased in both frequency and intensity, making large portions of Earth uninhabitable.  
- **Superstorms**: Hurricanes and typhoons grew larger and more destructive, devastating coastal cities.  
- **Megafires**: Wildfires engulfed vast regions, destroying homes, forests, and crops while releasing massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.  
- **Rising Seas**: Coastal cities like Jakarta, Miami, and Dhaka were submerged as sea levels rose, forcing millions to flee inland.  

### **Unlivable Cities**
Urban centers, once hubs of innovation and culture, became death traps. Overcrowding, decaying infrastructure, and lack of resources rendered many cities uninhabitable:  
- **Abandoned Megacities**: Cities like New York, Shanghai, and Mumbai saw mass evacuations, leaving towering ruins behind.  
- **Disease Outbreaks**: Poor sanitation and lack of healthcare in collapsing urban areas led to outbreaks of diseases like cholera, malaria, and new antibiotic-resistant pathogens.  

### **Rural Decline**
While cities emptied, rural areas offered little refuge. Crop failures and unpredictable weather made traditional farming unsustainable, and many rural communities were abandoned altogether.

## **The Migration Crisis**

### **Mass Movement of People**
The collapse of agriculture, infrastructure, and governance forced billions to migrate in search of safety and resources:  
- **Climate Refugees**: Entire populations fled regions rendered uninhabitable by desertification, flooding, and storms.  
- **Conflict Refugees**: Wars over water, food, and energy displaced millions, creating a new wave of stateless people.  

### **Overwhelmed Safe Zones**
The few regions still capable of sustaining life—such as parts of Canada, Scandinavia, and Siberia—became overwhelmed with refugees. Border controls tightened, and violent clashes erupted at checkpoints:  
- **Resource Gatekeeping**: Nations with remaining arable land and freshwater resources implemented draconian policies to protect their populations, often at the expense of refugees.  
- **Corporate Enclaves**: Private companies established fortified settlements to protect their assets, creating stark divides between the wealthy few and the desperate many.

## **Social and Political Fragmentation**

### **Collapse of Governance**
As resources dwindled and conflicts escalated, national governments lost the ability to maintain order:  
- **Failed States**: Dozens of nations collapsed into anarchy, their governments unable to respond to the crises.  
- **Rise of Corporations**: Mega-corporations filled the power vacuum, controlling regions through private security forces and resource monopolies.  
- **Localized Authority**: Communities turned inward, relying on localized governance and militias to survive.  

### **Cultural Decline**
The chaos led to the erosion of cultural and societal institutions:  
- **Loss of Education**: Schools and universities shuttered, leaving a generation without formal education.  
- **Collapse of Communication**: Global networks like the internet became unreliable, fragmenting humanity’s ability to share information.  
- **Despair and Nihilism**: For many, the collapse of civilization extinguished hope for the future, leading to widespread despair and a rise in extremist ideologies.

## **A World on the Brink**

By 390 years before Project Exodus, Earth was a shadow of its former self. The planet was plagued by a population collapse of unimaginable scale, unending natural disasters, and the disintegration of governments and societies. With cities abandoned, rural areas desolate, and billions dead or displaced, the remaining population clung to life in scattered enclaves, unsure whether humanity could survive the century.  

This era marked the beginning of the end for Earth as humanity’s home, setting the stage for the desperate measures that would eventually lead to Project Exodus.
