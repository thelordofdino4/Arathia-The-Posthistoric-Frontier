Earth: The Great Decline

390 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth is in the throes of its most severe population collapse in history. With famine, ecological disasters, and violent resource conflicts sweeping the globe, the planet’s population has plummeted to 2.4 billion. Urban centers crumble, rural areas are abandoned, and nations teeter on the brink of total collapse. Mega-corporations rise to dominate surviving regions, exacerbating inequality and further destabilizing the social order.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 2.4 billion, with the majority concentrated in resource-accessible regions or corporate enclaves.

Presence of Liquid Water: Severely diminished; freshwater sources are heavily polluted or overexploited. Rivers and lakes dry up, and desalination plants struggle to meet demand.

Chemical Environment:

Oceans are highly acidic, threatening marine ecosystems.

Atmospheric CO2 levels surpass 0.07%, intensifying the greenhouse effect.

Energy Sources:

Fossil fuels remain dominant but are increasingly scarce.

Solar and nuclear power expand in wealthier enclaves.

Widespread energy shortages lead to blackouts and rationing.

Physical Conditions:

Rising temperatures exacerbate desertification and heatwaves.

Frequent superstorms, flooding, and megafires render large areas uninhabitable.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 20%

Carbon Dioxide: 0.07% (critical contributor to climate instability)

Nitrogen: 78%

Climate Stability: Collapsed; unpredictable and extreme weather events dominate.

Radiation Protection: The ozone layer is partially depleted, increasing UV radiation exposure in some regions.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, but localized risks from over-mining and deforestation cause landslides and sinkholes.

Ecosystem Support:

Approximately 35% of species remain.

Ecosystems are fragmented and fail to provide adequate support for human or animal populations.

Economic Indicators:

Global economies are in freefall, with wealth concentrated in corporate enclaves.

Black markets flourish as formal trade networks collapse.

Military Capabilities:

National militaries remain functional but are repurposed for resource defense and internal control.

Corporate security forces rival or surpass traditional militaries in power.

Geographical Factors:

Coastal cities are submerged or abandoned.

Livable regions shrink to isolated zones, often near freshwater or arable land.

Demographics:

Aging population due to declining birth rates and high mortality.

Mass migrations create a global refugee crisis.

Technological Development:

Advances slow as resources shift toward survival rather than innovation.

Limited progress in environmental engineering and disaster mitigation.

International Relations:

Nations are increasingly fractured, with alliances dissolving over resource disputes.

Corporations hold de facto control over most international relations.

Environmental Considerations:

The Earth Reseeding Initiative operates amidst criticism and underfunding.

Conservation efforts shift to preserving genetic material rather than living ecosystems.

Magnetic Field: Stable and protective.

Geological Activity: Normal, though human activity exacerbates localized risks.

Mars: A Fragile Colony

390 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars continues its slow expansion despite dependency on Earth’s faltering supply lines. Domed habitats house a growing population of scientists and engineers, while terraforming efforts show incremental progress. Limited autonomy and increasing isolation push the colony toward self-sufficiency.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 400,000, primarily skilled laborers and their families.

Presence of Liquid Water: Subsurface ice extraction improves but remains insufficient for large-scale use.

Chemical Environment:

Atmosphere is primarily CO2; unbreathable without domes.

Initial efforts to introduce oxygen-producing microbes show limited success.

Energy Sources:

Solar arrays and nuclear reactors provide stable power.

Experiments with geothermal energy show promise.

Physical Conditions:

Harsh and unyielding; frequent dust storms challenge infrastructure.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%

Nitrogen: 79%

Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; slow progress in creating microclimates.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground facilities remain essential for safety.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; dust storms are the primary environmental hazard.

Ecosystem Support:

Hydroponic farms expand but cannot meet population demands.

Experimental biomes struggle to maintain balance.

Economic Indicators:

Heavily reliant on Belt and Earth imports for essential supplies.

Limited local manufacturing begins to alleviate supply issues.

Military Capabilities:

Minimal; security focuses on internal stability and resource protection.

Geographical Factors:

Expansion prioritizes access to subsurface ice deposits and stable terrain.

Demographics:

Young, skilled workforce; birth rates begin to rise among second-generation Martians.

Technological Development:

Advances in terraforming and life support, though progress is slow.

International Relations:

Increasingly strained due to Earth’s instability.

Tensions grow with the Belt over resource allocation.

Environmental Considerations:

Sustainability efforts focus on recycling and minimizing habitat degradation.

Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; reliance on artificial shielding continues.

Geological Activity: Minimal; construction zones remain stable.

The Belt: A Growing Power

390 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt emerges as a critical hub for resource extraction and interplanetary logistics. Mining stations expand into semi-permanent settlements, offering economic opportunity despite harsh living conditions. The Belt’s growing influence sparks tensions with Earth and Mars.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 1 million, with a mix of transient workers and long-term settlers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Ice mining operations provide sufficient water for habitats and fuel production.

Chemical Environment: Fully controlled within habitats; Earth-like atmospheric conditions maintained.

Energy Sources:

Solar power remains dominant.

Early fusion reactor prototypes undergo testing.

Physical Conditions:

Microgravity impacts health; rigorous exercise regimens are mandatory.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%

Nitrogen: 79%

Climate Stability: Artificially maintained; consistent within habitats.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures worker safety.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining operations carefully monitored to prevent accidents.

Ecosystem Support:

Hydroponics expand but rely on imports for nutritional variety.

Economic Indicators:

Rapid economic growth driven by resource demand.

Wealth disparities emerge between corporate elites and workers.

Military Capabilities:

Corporate security forces grow in size and sophistication.

Early weaponization of mining equipment sparks concern.

Geographical Factors:

Expansion focuses on resource-rich asteroids like Ceres, Psyche, and Vesta.

Demographics:

Predominantly male workforce; efforts to attract families and skilled professionals increase.

Technological Development:

Cutting-edge in mining and life support; early experiments in autonomous robotics.

International Relations:

Rising tensions with Earth and Mars over resource control.

Calls for greater autonomy gain traction among Belters.

Environmental Considerations:

Operations optimized for efficiency; long-term sustainability remains secondary.
