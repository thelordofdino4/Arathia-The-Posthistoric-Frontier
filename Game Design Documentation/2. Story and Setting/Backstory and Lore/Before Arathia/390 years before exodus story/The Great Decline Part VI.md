The Great Collapse, Part IV (Circa 390 YBE)

Emilia Kane stood at the edge of the once-bustling Cairo Metro Station, staring out at the sunbaked skyline. A thick haze tinted everything in shades of sepia. The Nile had shrunk to a muddy trickle—its banks caked with dust and littered with abandoned fishing boats. Ten years ago, Earth’s population hovered around nine billion; now, only a quarter of that remained.

Orion Parrish, her partner in the Earth Survey Commission, gently placed a handheld scanner against a nearby pillar. It beeped its reading: air toxicity levels were high, water contamination near-lethal. He let out a low whistle.

“I remember this city,” he said, his voice muffled by a cloth respirator. “People swarmed these streets. Traffic jams, vendors shouting… It was chaos, but it was alive.”

Emilia glanced at him, recalling her own memories of Cairo from more hopeful days. “We used to say entire nations were on the brink of transformation. Now the entire world’s on the brink of oblivion.” She flipped through her battered notebook, which contained weeks of scribbled data on population centers in collapse. “From the Great Lakes region to the Sahara, everywhere we go, we find the same story: mass migration, famine, plague.”

They started walking through the deserted station. Faded posters clung to the walls, advertising long-defunct relief programs. One depicted a beaming family, next to the words “Together, We Rebuild.” Torn across the mother’s hopeful face was a scrawl that read “Too Late.”

A Continent in Free Fall

Out in the scorching midday sun, they saw the remains of what had once been the beating heart of North Africa. Proud nations—Egypt, Sudan, Libya—had each tried to weather the climate storms and resource wars in their own ways. Some had turned to strict rationing; others had clamped down under martial law. But the last decade had overwhelmed even the most resilient states.

“The surveys from Khartoum and Tripoli paint a grim picture,” Emilia said, thumbing through more notes. “In less than ten years, we’ve lost over half these countries’ populations. Crops have withered, the big rivers have run low.” Her hand tightened around the notebook. “And it’s the same across so many regions—collapsed governments, broken supply chains, roving militia groups.”

“We used to talk about enclaves,” Orion muttered. “But entire nations are fracturing. Some leaders tried to unify what’s left, only to be swept aside by famine or civil war.”

A ragged figure, huddled against a pillar, rose as they approached—a young man with hollow cheeks. “You’re from the Commission?” he croaked in accented English. “We heard rumors you might bring relief.”

Emilia dropped to her knees, offering him a few ration bars. “I’m sorry—we don’t have much left. Our job is to document what’s happening, see if we can coordinate aid from what’s left of the global community.”

He let out a hollow laugh, eyes flicking to the bars. “Document us, then. Tell them we’re starving. Tell them thousands died this week alone.”

One Nation’s Last Breath

By late afternoon, Emilia and Orion boarded a barely functional truck heading north. Its driver claimed he was ferrying any survivors he could find toward the Mediterranean coast, where rumors of a supply ship lingered in half-deserted harbors. The truck rattled over cracked highways. They passed uprooted palm trees, desiccated fields, and entire villages reduced to rubble.

The driver, a once-proud father of five, recounted how the government in Cairo had dissolved under the weight of riots and food shortages. “They tried to impose martial law, but the soldiers deserted when rations ran out,” he said, his voice trembling with fatigue. “We used to have unity, you know? Now we just have dust.”

At a makeshift checkpoint, a few armed youths waved them through, too exhausted to ask for bribes. Orion glanced at Emilia in silence—neither had words for the heartbreak in these children’s eyes.

As the truck neared the coast, the air grew thick with the stench of stagnation. They found the harbor flooded with rotting debris and half-sunken fishing trawlers. A few desperate souls wandered the piers, searching for a rumored vessel said to be carrying relief supplies. No ship was in sight.

“This place once fed millions,” the driver said, gesturing to the decaying port infrastructure. “We exported produce, seafood… Now, there’s nothing.” He turned to Emilia, gaze hollow. “How could it all vanish in ten years?”

Emilia looked out at the dark water. “The planet was already on the edge. Climate extremes. Resource depletion. Then the wars came, the pandemics… it created the perfect storm.”

The Global View

By the time they parted ways with the driver, the sun was setting. Orion’s handheld scanner crackled with incoming data from other Commission teams still operating worldwide. Reports spoke of once-thriving nations brought to their knees:

In the Indian Subcontinent, monsoon patterns had collapsed, leaving entire provinces scorched and withered. Cholera ravaged the refugee camps along dwindling rivers, while a few survivors clung to the foot of the Himalayas, hoping to melt ice for water. Farther east, the megacities of Asia lay dark and silent, their power grids offline. Tens of millions were simply gone—victims of famine or disease, or lost in the chaos of governments falling.

Across the Americas, the Mississippi Basin was now a choking dust bowl, pushing refugees north in desperate search of cooler latitudes. But unstoppable wildfires raged through what used to be farmland, and radio stations that once connected distant enclaves had all but gone silent. Even Canada, long considered a safe haven, struggled under the weight of countless displaced families arriving by the day.

“Two-point-four billion,” Orion whispered, reading the Commission’s latest estimate. “If that. One last freefall… and this is where we land.”

Emilia chewed her lip. “So many governments tried, but there was never a unified effort. By the time the horrors of the climate wars set in, by the time pandemics ravaged entire continents… it was too late.”

Fading Hope at the Horizon

In the twilight glow, they found shelter in a half-collapsed warehouse. Emilia jotted notes by flashlight, summarizing the day’s findings: entire nation-states, once proud and populous, drained of life in a single, brutal decade.

“Do you think we’ll ever recover?” Orion asked, voice barely above a whisper.

Emilia paused. “If we do… it’ll take centuries. We have to record this so future generations understand how it happened. That it didn’t all vanish in a single war or plague. It was everything at once—nature, conflict, greed, and neglect…”

They heard footsteps—another wandering soul seeking shelter. Silhouetted against the starlight, a woman and two small children peered in. Emilia gestured them inside, handing over the last of her ration bars. The children’s gaunt faces broke her heart.

Outside, faint lights from a distant settlement flickered. Perhaps it was some philanthropic holdout or a corporate-run outpost with leftover supplies. Perhaps it was just another cluster of survivors, clinging to hope like a sputtering candle flame.

Even at the nadir of human existence, families went on living, searching for water, searching for tomorrow. For Emilia and Orion, everything they documented—from Cairo’s ghostly streets to the devastated coasts—fed into the great tapestry of suffering. But the Commission’s data also represented a final stand against oblivion. They were historians in a dying world, chronicling each last heartbeat of civilization.

As the children curled up for warmth, Orion quietly set his scanner to transmit that day’s census findings to any satellite link that still functioned. It was uncertain whether the data would ever reach a functioning command center, but they had to try.

“At least the world will know,” Emilia murmured, shutting her notebook with trembling hands. “If not now, then one day… someone will see.” She glanced at Orion, her eyes weighed with exhaustion. “Two-point-four billion… and falling.”

“But not zero,” he said, mustering a small flicker of resolve. “Not yet.”

A single fluorescent tube buzzed overhead in the cramped subterranean chamber, painting the scene in a pale, sickly glow. Beyond thick steel doors, the world was dissolving into chaos—but here, in the clandestine bunker that remained of what once was a major government complex, three individuals pored over the latest casualty reports.

Nora Vale, a tall woman with sharp features and a streak of gray in her hair, leaned forward. The lines on her face bore testimony to the past decade—ten years of watching the global population drop from nine billion to just over two. She tapped at a flickering terminal, bringing up a map riddled with red zones.

“Khartoum, Tripoli, Cairo…” Her voice quivered as she read the list. “Gone or close to it. We’ve lost entire nations—not enclaves, entire nations—to famine, disease, war. All in a single decade.”

Across the table stood Leyton Vance, a former corporate security head. Tall, with an air of coiled tension, he wore a ragged uniform stripped of any insignias. “My contacts from the Eastern Corridor Enclave said the same thing. They can’t even call themselves an ‘enclave’ anymore. Their leadership’s dead, supply routes cut. They’re just survivors on borrowed time.” His gaze drifted over the gloom of the bunker. “And yet we’re still here, Nora. Still clinging.”

In the corner, a faint cough interrupted their exchange. Director Yuan Li—once second-in-command at a global intelligence agency—stepped into the circle of light. Deep-set eyes and a silver shock of hair gave the older man an air of haunted authority. “The Earth Survey Commission’s last transmission came in this morning,” he said, voice rasping. “You’ve seen the numbers. Two-point-four billion, if that.”

Nora Vale frowned, recalling the Commission’s lead field teams—people like Emilia Kane and Orion Parrish—gathering data across ravaged continents. “Emilia’s group reported utter devastation in North Africa. But it’s the same from the Americas to Asia. The Subcontinent’s a husk. East Asia is silent. Europe’s fractured beyond recognition.” She paused, eyes flicking to the terminal. “No one saw a collapse of this speed.”

“That’s because we never imagined the storms, the wars, and the pandemics would converge so perfectly,” Yuan Li replied grimly. “Our governments each had partial intel; our agencies saw slivers. None coordinated properly until it was too late. And now, all that’s left of the once-sprawling deep state is here—this bunker, plus maybe a handful of sites scattered around the globe.”

Leyton gave a bitter smile. “Global famine, unstoppable plagues, unstoppable people desperate to survive… This was the perfect storm. I once led a paramilitary detail for HeliosCorp, you know. We had the resources, we had the technology—and we squandered it for profit. I’m not sure there’s any atonement now.”

Nora’s eyes burned with exhaustion. She brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear. “We need to figure out next steps. We can’t just record the death throes of civilization—we have to do something.”

Yuan Li let out a weary sigh. “The deep-state apparatus we once had—backup satellites, hidden storehouses, advanced labs—many are gone or under the control of warlords. The old chain of command is shattered. I have a few loyal contacts left, but not enough to restore entire nations.”

Nora studied the overhead map. Regions glowed with dire warnings: Earthquakes in the Pacific Rim. Droughts across the heartland. Columns of refugees crossing barren frontiers. “Then we start smaller. We focus on pockets of hope, pockets that can still be salvaged. If we can help them hold on, maybe we buy humanity some time.”

Leyton nodded. “We can coordinate with that Antarctica research station—what’s left of it. They still have functioning desalination and hydroponics. Also, that rumored ‘Himalayan Sanctuary’—the one rumored to be run by a coalition of ex-government scientists.”

“Rumors,” Yuan Li said, shaking his head. “We have so many rumors. Solid intel is scarce. But it’s worth checking. If we can confirm they’re real, maybe we can funnel resources—medical supplies, seeds, something.”

A sudden static crackle drew their attention to a dusty comms console in the corner. Nora and Leyton exchanged a glance, then hurried over. Yuan Li flicked a switch. Through the haze of static, a faint voice emerged:

“—Nora Vale, Leyton Vance… we read your last sub-burst, still analyzing… People are starving… coordinate… they deserve to know… repeat… final transmission—”

The signal dissolved into white noise. Leyton cursed under his breath, adjusting the dials in vain.

“We’re not the only ones left,” Nora whispered, hope and dread mingling in her tone. “They’re out there, trying to do exactly what we are—keep the lights on, keep records. But everything’s collapsing too fast.”

From behind them, Yuan Li cleared his throat. “There’s one more detail. We intercepted a scramble-coded message referencing the Mars Initiative. A handful of elites are still launching off-world from desert bases in East Asia. They’re ferrying people, equipment… If they succeed, they might abandon Earth altogether.”

Nora inhaled sharply, heart pounding with indignation. “Typical. The wealthy run to Mars while billions die here.”

Leyton’s knuckles tightened around the console’s edge. “That’s how it’s always been. But if those supply ships to Mars still exist, maybe we can commandeer resources. Medicine. Food. Something.”

Yuan Li shrugged, the movement fraught with weariness. “We’d need an army or cunning infiltration. Don’t forget: they have advanced security, private militias. As far as I’m concerned, it’s a long shot.”

Nora shut her eyes briefly, overwhelmed by the magnitude of loss. Every second, more people succumbed—famine, storms, disease, violence. “We can’t save everyone. But we can’t just surrender either. This bunker, our data, the last threads of intelligence networks… it has to mean something.”

Leyton exhaled, gaze fixed on the flickering map. “Alright. We regroup. We gather what fragments remain of government and corporate tech. We focus on stabilizing a few regions, see if we can preserve pockets of civilization. And yes, if we see a chance to wrest supplies from those Mars shipments—” His voice trailed off, a steel edge to it. “We’ll take it.”

Yuan Li stared at them both. “I’ll coordinate what’s left of the comms. You find the enclaves with a pulse. And if we can muster any actual relief—”

Nora nodded, finishing his sentence. “We deliver it. If not, we at least record their existence before it’s too late.”

A heavy silence filled the bunker. The fluorescent light flickered, and in that moment, it felt as though the entire weight of Earth’s collapse settled on them. Yet in their eyes, a glimmer of resolve shone.

Ten years ago, the world boasted nine billion souls. Now only a quarter remained, scattered across continents turned hostile by greed, disaster, and neglect. But from this hidden stronghold, Nora Vale, Leyton Vance, and Director Yuan Li refused to let civilization vanish without a fight. They had lost almost everything—nations, families, entire ways of life. All that remained was the faint, stubborn belief that humanity could yet salvage a future from the wreckage.

Far above, the Earth Survey Commission’s satellites still circled, battered by cosmic radiation but occasionally transmitting data. And somewhere in the desert, rockets might be fueling for one last trek off-world. Between these two extremes—escape or extinction—Nora, Leyton, and the battered remnants of Earth’s deep state prepared to chart a third path: defiance in the face of oblivion, forging hope out of a dying world’s final embers.
