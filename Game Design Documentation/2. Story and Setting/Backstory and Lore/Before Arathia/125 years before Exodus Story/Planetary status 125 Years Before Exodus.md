Earth: A Planet in Terminal Decline
125 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth’s ecosystems were nearing complete collapse, with 89% of species extinct and CO2 levels reaching 4.4%. The planet remained habitable only through artificial management, with isolated enclaves and artificial biomes sustaining its dwindling population of 350 million. The mega-corporations were in their final years of dominance, as inefficiency and public unrest set the stage for their eventual collapse. Humanity’s focus shifted toward Mars, the Asteroid Belt, and ambitious colonization attempts like Venus, as Earth’s decline appeared irreversible.

Population: Approximately 350 million, concentrated in heavily controlled urban zones and isolated enclaves.
Presence of Liquid Water: Artificial reservoirs and aquifers sustain life; natural water sources are either depleted or heavily polluted.
Chemical Environment: Extreme toxicity in urban regions, with widespread contamination of air and soil.
Energy Sources: Predominantly nuclear and fusion, with minor renewable projects.
Physical Conditions: Stabilized but hostile; artificial systems maintain minimal functionality in most regions.
Atmospheric Composition: Oxygen: 17.5%, Carbon Dioxide: 4.4%, Nitrogen: 78%.
Climate Stability: Unstable; extreme weather remains frequent due to high CO2 levels.
Radiation Protection: Fragmented ozone layer; UV radiation exposure remains a concern.
Geophysical Stability: Reduced industrial activity has stabilized seismic risks, but abandoned mining zones remain hazardous.
Ecosystem Support: Artificially sustained biomes preserve remnants of biodiversity; natural ecosystems are nonviable.
Economic Indicators: Centralized and controlled by failing corporate systems; preparations for global unification underway.
Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces dominate, but their influence wanes as public uprisings grow.
Geographical Factors: Urban zones dominate the habitable landscape; rural regions are abandoned or exploited for resources.
Demographics: Aging population with low birth rates and minimal migration to space.
Technological Development: Focused on interplanetary expansion and survival systems.
International Relations: Deteriorating as corporate rule falters; factions emerge in preparation for global unification.
Environmental Considerations: Restoration efforts are deprioritized as focus shifts toward off-world survival.
Magnetic Field: Stable but insufficient to counteract radiation in unshielded zones.
Geological Activity: Normal tectonic activity, though abandoned industrial zones pose risks.

Mars: Steady Progress Toward Habitability
125 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars experienced steady growth, with terraforming expanding its habitable surface to 18%. While most of the planet required protective habitats, equatorial regions allowed for limited outdoor activity with only occasional oxygen supplementation. Mars’ population grew to 17 million, driven by advancements in agriculture, energy, and atmospheric processing.

Population: Approximately 17 million, distributed across expanding domed cities and equatorial settlements.
Presence of Liquid Water: Expanding reservoirs and controlled aquifers sustain agriculture and habitation.
Chemical Environment: Oxygen levels in equatorial regions are sufficient for limited unassisted human activity.
Energy Sources: Fusion and solar power dominate, supplemented by localized wind farms.
Physical Conditions: Equatorial regions allow limited outdoor activity, while most areas still require habitats.
Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones): Oxygen: 21%, Nitrogen: 79%.
Atmospheric Composition (Equatorial Regions): Oxygen: 12%, CO2: 3%.
Climate Stability: Stable in terraformed zones; extreme cold persists in unaltered regions.
Radiation Protection: Electromagnetic shielding protects surface settlements.
Geophysical Stability: Stable, with terraforming projects carefully managed.
Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponic and soil-based agriculture; introduction of Earth flora and fauna to controlled environments.
Economic Indicators: Strong growth driven by self-sufficiency and resource exports.
Military Capabilities: Defensive forces protect settlements and manage resource security.
Geographical Factors: Expansion focuses on equatorial regions; polar areas are reserved for resource extraction.
Demographics: Balanced population with an increasing younger generation.
Technological Development: Advancements in terraforming and life-support systems continue.
International Relations: Cooperative ties with the Belt and orbital habitats; growing independence from Earth.
Environmental Considerations: Sustainability is a priority in Martian development policies.
Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; reliance on artificial shielding persists.
Geological Activity: Stable; conditions support infrastructure growth.

Venus: Humanity’s Boldest Colonization Attempt
125 Years Before Project Exodus

The Venus colonization effort marked one of humanity’s most ambitious ventures, focusing on floating aerostat cities in Venus’ upper atmosphere. Despite initial technological breakthroughs, the project was abandoned after only a few years due to insurmountable challenges posed by Venus’ extreme environment.

Population: Fewer than 10,000, with temporary workers and researchers stationed in floating habitats.
Presence of Liquid Water: Extracted from atmospheric sulfuric acid clouds using experimental processing systems.
Chemical Environment: Carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid dominate; atmospheric processing efforts achieve limited success.
Energy Sources: Solar power is abundant but inefficient due to atmospheric density; nuclear reactors provide stable energy.
Physical Conditions: Habitats operate at altitudes where pressure and temperature are Earth-like, but lower regions remain inaccessible.
Atmospheric Composition (Habitat Zones): Oxygen: 21%, Nitrogen: 79%.
Atmospheric Composition (Surface): CO2: 96%, Nitrogen: 3%.
Climate Stability: Stable in upper-atmosphere habitats; surface conditions remain extreme.
Radiation Protection: Thick atmosphere shields habitats from cosmic radiation.
Geophysical Stability: Stable, though surface operations are impossible due to high pressure and temperature.
Ecosystem Support: None; experiments with extremophiles and artificial systems are ongoing.
Economic Indicators: Resource extraction potential remains untapped due to technological limitations.
Military Capabilities: None; security forces manage research stations.
Geographical Factors: Limited to atmospheric zones; no surface operations possible.
Demographics: Temporary workforce focused on scientific research and habitat development.
Technological Development: Advances in materials science and atmospheric processing are notable outcomes.
International Relations: Governed as a joint Earth-Mars research initiative.
Environmental Considerations: Abandoned due to high costs and risks.
Magnetic Field: Nonexistent, though atmospheric density provides natural protection.
Geological Activity: Irrelevant due to lack of surface operations.
