A Corporate Gamble

Setting: Helios Industries Boardroom, Earth’s Orbital Station Delta

The boardroom, encased in reinforced glass, overlooked Earth’s mottled surface far below. The planet’s green and blue hues had long faded into a patchwork of grays and browns. Hovering in geosynchronous orbit, the orbital station was a symbol of humanity’s tenacity—and its hubris.

Seated around the polished titanium table were representatives from Helios Industries, Ascendant Logistics, and Orbital Dynamics Corporation. At the head of the table sat Frederick Maren, CEO of Helios Industries, his expression as unreadable as the data streams flickering across his augmented reality glasses.

"Venus," Maren began, his voice calm but commanding. "It was supposed to be our trump card. An alternative to Mars, under our control. Yet here we are, bleeding resources for a project that refuses to yield results."

The room murmured in agreement, save for one figure: Elise Navarro, the Chief Engineer overseeing operations on Venus. She tightened her grip on her stylus, waiting for her moment to speak.

The Costs of Ambition

“We’ve poured trillions into atmospheric processors, floating habitats, and automated extraction drones,” said Damien Colburn, CFO of Ascendant Logistics. “And what do we have to show for it? A handful of aerostat cities that require constant maintenance and produce nothing of value.”

“The costs are unsustainable,” chimed in Amanda Greaves, COO of Orbital Dynamics Corporation. “Our shareholders are demanding results. We either make Venus profitable, or we cut our losses.”

Navarro finally spoke, her tone sharp. “Profitable? Venus was never going to turn a profit in five years, let alone ten. It’s a long-term investment, a lifeline for when Mars becomes uninhabitable or overcrowded.”

Maren raised a hand to silence her. “Mars is stable for now. Venus was always Plan B. But if Plan B bankrupts us before it’s viable, what’s the point?”

A Desperate Alternative

The discussion veered into a heated exchange. Some executives argued for redirecting resources to Mars, bolstering its fragile ecosystems. Others saw potential in doubling down on Venus, hoping for a breakthrough that could justify the costs.

Navarro’s frustration boiled over. “You’re missing the bigger picture. Mars is dominated by its existing settlements and governance structures. Venus is a blank slate, one we can shape without interference. Isn’t that what you all wanted? A planet that doesn’t answer to Earth’s corporations or Martian oversight?”

“Idealistic nonsense,” Colburn snapped. “Venus isn’t a blank slate; it’s a death trap. The atmospheric storms alone destroy more equipment than we can replace.”

Greaves leaned forward, her eyes narrowing. “And what happens if the Belt—or worse, Mars—finds out we’ve been diverting resources from joint ventures to fund this pipe dream? We’ll lose our leverage. Our credibility.”

An Ethical Quandary

Navarro couldn’t hold back any longer. “What about the people? The engineers, the scientists, the workers who’ve staked their lives on Venus? If you abandon this project, you’re abandoning them.”

Maren’s gaze fixed on her, unflinching. “Everyone knew the risks when they signed on. They’ll be evacuated—eventually. But resources must be prioritized. We can’t save everyone.”

The silence that followed was deafening. Navarro’s jaw tightened. She had seen firsthand the sacrifices made on Venus. Engineers working double shifts to keep aerostats operational. Scientists risking exposure to gather data from the acidic clouds. These weren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet; they were lives.

A Secret Decision

As the meeting adjourned, the executives filed out, their discussions shifting to other ventures. Navarro lingered, staring at the data streams projected on the table. She knew Maren’s promises of eventual evacuation were hollow. By the time resources were “prioritized,” it would be too late for many on Venus.

That night, in the privacy of her quarters, Navarro began transmitting encrypted messages to trusted contacts on Venus. Using her authority, she diverted supply shipments originally earmarked for other projects. Food, water, oxygen—everything necessary to sustain the personnel on Venus for as long as possible.

She also initiated plans to smuggle critical personnel off the planet, prioritizing those with families and those whose skills could be used elsewhere in the solar system. It was a logistical nightmare, but she knew it was the only way to protect the people who had dedicated their lives to Venus.

A Final Gamble

Weeks later, as the first evacuation shuttle ascended from Venus’ turbulent skies, Navarro watched from Earth’s orbital station. She knew her actions would be discovered eventually. Her career, her reputation, everything she had worked for—it would all be destroyed.

But as the shuttle’s engines flared against the backdrop of Venus’ yellow haze, she felt a glimmer of hope. She had made a choice. A gamble. One that valued lives over profits, humanity over greed.

And perhaps, one day, the corporations would learn what she already knew: survival wasn’t just about holding onto power. It was about ensuring there was something worth surviving for.
