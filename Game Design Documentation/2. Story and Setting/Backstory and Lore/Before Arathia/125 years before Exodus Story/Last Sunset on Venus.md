Last Sunset on Venus

Location: Altis Aerostat Colony, 60 km Above Venus’ SurfaceTimeframe: 125 Years Before Project Exodus

The air inside the observation dome of the Altis Aerostat Colony was still, except for the quiet hum of the oxygen recyclers. Outside, the orange glow of Venus’ thick atmosphere bathed the world in eternal twilight. For Cassian Rey, a young settler, it was the only sunset he had ever known—a sunset that stretched endlessly across the sky, both beautiful and haunting.

Cassian pressed his hand against the reinforced glass, his breath fogging the surface. The colony’s loudspeakers crackled to life, carrying the voice of Administrator Talia Marsh, her words measured and somber.

“It is with great regret that I confirm the Venus colonization project will be officially terminated within the next 48 hours. All personnel will be evacuated to orbital transport ships for reassignment.”

The announcement was met with silence, broken only by the muffled murmurs of the colony’s inhabitants. Cassian felt a sinking weight in his chest. For the settlers who had dedicated years to this harsh, alien world, the news was not just a logistical update—it was the death knell of a shared dream.

A Dream Deferred

Cassian wandered the narrow corridors of the aerostat, passing clusters of settlers huddled together. Some argued in hushed tones, while others sat in stunned silence. He found himself drawn to the biodome, where the colony’s meager vegetation swayed gently under artificial lights. It was one of the few places on Venus where green thrived.

Dr. Elara Voss, the colony’s lead botanist, was carefully tending to a small plot of genetically engineered wheat. She looked up as Cassian entered.

“You should be packing,” she said softly, though her hands never stopped working.

“I don’t want to leave,” Cassian replied, his voice trembling. “Venus could have been… it could have been ours.”

Dr. Voss sighed, standing to face him. “I know. I’ve spent half my life trying to make this world livable. But some dreams are bigger than the resources we have.”

“So we just give up?” Cassian asked, frustration bubbling to the surface. “All the work, all the hope—we’re just going to leave it to rot?”

Dr. Voss placed a hand on his shoulder. “Sometimes, retreat isn’t surrender. It’s survival. But that doesn’t mean we can’t leave something behind.”

The Time Capsule

Word spread quickly through the colony about Dr. Voss’s idea: a symbolic gesture to mark their efforts on Venus and offer a beacon for future colonists. Cassian threw himself into the project, organizing contributions from settlers eager to leave a legacy.

The time capsule itself was a small, heat-resistant container designed to withstand the planet’s extreme conditions. Into it, settlers placed items that represented their lives and dreams:

A small vial of soil from Earth, brought by one of the original settlers.

A schematic of the aerostat’s atmospheric processors, signed by the engineering team.

A handwritten journal detailing the first successful crop grown in the biodome.

Cassian’s own contribution: a simple sketch of Venus, drawn from memory, with the words “We will return” scrawled in bold letters.

The settlers gathered on the observation deck for the capsule’s deployment. Administrator Marsh stood at the front of the crowd, her usually stoic demeanor softened by the occasion.

“This capsule is more than a marker,” she said. “It’s a promise. A promise that humanity doesn’t give up on its dreams, even when the odds are against us.”

The Final Sunset

As the capsule was lowered into Venus’ atmosphere, designed to rest atop a reinforced platform near the colony’s anchor, Cassian felt a bittersweet mix of pride and loss. The settlers lingered, watching the faint glow of the capsule’s descent until it disappeared into the haze below.

Dr. Voss stood beside Cassian, her gaze fixed on the horizon. “You know, one day someone will find it. Maybe it’ll be centuries from now, but they’ll see what we left behind.”

“And they’ll know we tried,” Cassian added.

The loudspeakers chimed again, signaling the final evacuation call. As the settlers began to board the shuttles that would take them to orbit, Cassian took one last look at the planet he had dreamed of calling home. The endless sunset, beautiful and unforgiving, painted the clouds in shades of amber and crimson.

He whispered to himself, “We will return.”

And with that, he stepped aboard the shuttle, leaving Venus behind—for now.
