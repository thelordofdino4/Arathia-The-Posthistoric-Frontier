## **Completion of the Fleet**  

### **Final Tests and Certifications**  
In the years leading up to this moment, rigorous testing ensured the fleet was prepared for the challenges of interstellar travel:  
- **FTL Engines**: Each ship’s faster-than-light propulsion systems were tested for reliability and efficiency, ensuring they could endure the long journeys ahead.  
- **Life Support Systems**: Advanced recycling systems for air, water, and waste were pushed to their limits to guarantee sustainability for millions over centuries.  
- **Autonomous Management**: AI systems underwent final updates and testing to handle navigation, maintenance, and onboard operations without human oversight.  

### **Fleet Overview**  
Each ship was a marvel of engineering, representing the pinnacle of humanity’s technological achievement:  
- **Population Capacity**: Designed to carry **2–5 million passengers** per ship, along with supplies, ecosystems, and cultural archives.  
- **Artificial Biomes**: Self-sustaining ecosystems supported food production, biodiversity, and psychological well-being for passengers.  
- **Modular Construction**: Ships were designed for adaptability, allowing for repairs and upgrades en route or after reaching their destinations.

## **The Passenger Selection Process**  

### **Boarding Begins**  
With the fleet ready, the process of loading passengers began:  
- **Departure Points**: Passengers were transported to staging hubs on **Mars**, **Jupiter’s moons**, and **deep-space habitats** before being assigned to specific ships.  
- **Streamlined Logistics**: AI-managed systems coordinated the movement of millions of people, minimizing delays and ensuring equitable distribution.  

### **Passenger Demographics**  
The fleet represented a cross-section of humanity, though the selection process was fraught with controversy:  
- **Skilled Professionals**: Scientists, engineers, medical personnel, and other essential workers were prioritized to ensure the success of future colonies.  
- **Corporate Elites**: Many wealthy individuals secured passage through influence or wealth, sparking outrage among the general population.  
- **Lottery Winners**: A small percentage of seats were allocated via a global lottery, offering hope to those without connections or specialized skills.  
- **Cultural Preservationists**: Artists, historians, and linguists were included to maintain and pass on humanity’s cultural legacy.

## **Departure Points: Humanity’s Last Strongholds**  

### **Mars**  
As humanity’s most developed colony, Mars served as the primary departure hub:  
- **Massive Staging Areas**: Domed cities were converted into temporary housing for passengers awaiting transport.  
- **Celebrations and Mourning**: Mars-based settlers bid farewell to the solar system, marking the occasion with both hope and sorrow.  

### **Jupiter’s Moons**  
Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto hosted smaller-scale departures:  
- **Research Stations Repurposed**: Scientific outposts became staging areas for evacuees.  
- **Harsh Conditions**: The extreme environments of Jupiter’s moons added urgency to the evacuation efforts.  

### **Deep-Space Habitats**  
Orbital habitats in the Asteroid Belt and beyond contributed a significant number of passengers:  
- **Self-Sufficient Colonies**: Many deep-space habitats had grown accustomed to independence but acknowledged the necessity of joining the fleet.  
- **Resource Hubs**: These habitats also contributed critical supplies and materials to the fleet’s final preparations.
