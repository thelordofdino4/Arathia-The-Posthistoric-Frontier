Earth: Continued Decline
275 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth remained a planet of shrinking populations and collapsing ecosystems. With fewer than 700 million inhabitants, humanity’s cradle was increasingly unrecognizable, dominated by urban decay, industrial ruins, and uninhabitable wastelands. Technological advancements focused on interstellar ambitions rather than planetary restoration, leaving Earth to languish.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 680 million, concentrated in surviving urban enclaves.

Presence of Liquid Water: Scarce and polluted; desalination plants provide minimal relief.

Chemical Environment: Toxic; soil, air, and water contamination widespread.

Energy Sources: Dominated by nuclear and renewable systems; experimental fusion limited to elite enclaves.

Physical Conditions: Desertification, flooding, and extreme weather events render most regions uninhabitable.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 17.8%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.15% (accelerating ecological collapse)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Nonexistent; erratic and severe weather patterns dominate.

Radiation Protection: Ozone layer fragmented, exposing more regions to harmful UV radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Relatively stable, though localized resource extraction risks remain.

Ecosystem Support: Fewer than 15% of species remain; most biodiversity preserved in artificial biomes or genetic archives.

Economic Indicators: Local economies barely functional; dominated by corporate and enclave systems.

Military Capabilities: Fragmented; remnants of national militaries operate under corporate control.

Geographical Factors: Less than 15% of Earth’s surface is habitable, concentrated in temperate zones.

Demographics: Aging population; emigration of youth to off-world colonies accelerates decline.

Technological Development: Focused on interstellar projects; Earth restoration efforts abandoned.

International Relations: Nonexistent; corporate governance dominates remaining regions.

Environmental Considerations: Artificial biomes and genetic archives are humanity’s last connection to biodiversity.

Magnetic Field: Stable but insufficient for mitigating surface radiation threats.

Geological Activity: Minimal; natural tectonic processes unaffected by human decline.

Mars: A Collapsing Colony
275 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars reached its breaking point as declining population and resource scarcity forced the colony into contraction. Once humanity’s beacon of hope, the Red Planet became a cautionary tale of the challenges of sustaining life on inhospitable worlds.

Key Points:

Population: Fewer than 3 million, clustered in consolidated domed cities.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable but limited; reliant on aquifers and ice mining.

Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated; breathable air confined to domed habitats.

Energy Sources: Solar and nuclear energy support basic needs; fusion efforts stalled.

Physical Conditions: Hostile; habitable zones confined to domes and underground facilities.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially regulated; no progress in expanding terraformed areas.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground shelters provide necessary shielding.

Geophysical Stability: Stable, though resource extraction continues to strain infrastructure.

Ecosystem Support: Minimal; hydroponic systems barely meet reduced population needs.

Economic Indicators: Economic activity declines sharply; focus shifts to preservation over growth.

Military Capabilities: Reduced; security forces maintain order in dwindling population centers.

Geographical Factors: Consolidation in equatorial regions for optimal resource access.

Demographics: Aging population; emigration to the Belt exacerbates labor shortages.

Technological Development: Focused on sustaining existing systems and archiving advancements.

International Relations: Limited interaction with Earth and the Belt; insular policies dominate.

Environmental Considerations: Preservation over expansion; terraforming halted.

Magnetic Field: Lacking; habitats remain reliant on artificial shielding.

Geological Activity: Stable; infrastructure focused on safety and efficiency.

The Belt: Humanity’s Lifeline
275 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt cemented its role as the primary supplier of resources for humanity’s dwindling off-world colonies. With over 30 million inhabitants, it became the most populous and industrially advanced region in human civilization.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 30 million, spread across thriving mining and manufacturing stations.

Presence of Liquid Water: Derived from ice mining; supports habitats and fuels exports.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated within habitats; Earth-like conditions maintained.

Energy Sources: Solar and advanced fusion power sustain industrial growth.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity mitigated by health technologies and habitat design.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; consistent and optimized for efficiency.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety across stations.

Geophysical Stability: Highly monitored to prevent mining accidents and habitat failures.

Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponics meet food demands; limited imports from Mars and Earth.

Economic Indicators: Thriving; resource exports underpin interstellar expansion efforts.

Military Capabilities: Sophisticated corporate security forces ensure stability and autonomy.

Geographical Factors: Strategic hubs near resource-rich asteroids like Ceres and Vesta.

Demographics: Diverse and growing population; strong cultural identity unique to the Belt.

Technological Development: Leading in mining, AI, and fusion power applications.

International Relations: Increasingly autonomous; Belt corporations dominate interstellar ventures.

Environmental Considerations: Efficient and sustainable operations minimize ecological impact.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding fully integrated into habitats.

Geological Activity: Strictly controlled; safety prioritized in mining operations.
