Earth’s Cold Indifference

265 Years Before Project Exodus

The boardroom was a fortress of luxury. Thick glass windows offered a panoramic view of Earth’s sprawling megacities, their shimmering lights a stark contrast to the dim realities of Mars. The room itself exuded wealth: polished oak furniture, holographic displays embedded in the table, and a ceiling projection of Earth from orbit—an ever-present reminder of the planet’s dominance.

A young corporate analyst, Clara Ainsworth, sat at the far end of the table. Her position was clear: she was an observer, a note-taker, a cog in the massive machine of Earth’s corporate oligarchy. She clutched her tablet tightly, the screen glowing with the agenda for today’s summit.

Opening Discussions

The executives entered one by one, each representing the most powerful megacorporations shaping humanity’s future—and its present strife. James Calder of EarthFirst Dynamics took his customary seat at the head of the table, his piercing eyes sweeping the room. To his left, Victoria Hensleigh of Helios Industries sipped a glass of water, her demeanor cold and calculating. Isaac Thorne of Ascendant Logistics adjusted his tie with practiced precision, his expression calm but detached. Across from them sat Angela Cross, the newly appointed CEO of Terragene Industries, her face composed but her presence bristling with restrained energy.

Calder’s voice cut through the low murmur of small talk.

Calder:
“Let’s get straight to it. Mars’ economy continues to falter. Their resource output has dropped 12% this quarter, and their population decline is accelerating. Suggestions?”

Hensleigh leaned forward, her silver-streaked hair catching the ambient light.

Hensleigh:
“We cut subsidies to their agricultural programs. They’re inefficient, and their reliance on Earth’s seed stock is a drain. Let them figure out how to feed themselves with what they have left.”

Clara’s stomach turned, but she said nothing. Her tablet recorded Hensleigh’s words with clinical detachment.

Thorne:
“If we do that, the Belt’s colonies will pounce. They’re already courting Martian engineers with promises of better pay and resources. Ascendant Logistics has flagged multiple BeltCorp operations offering recruitment incentives. If we squeeze Mars too hard, we risk losing the workforce entirely.”

Hensleigh:
“Better to cut our losses now than let them drag us down with them.”

Angela Cross’s calm voice interjected.

Cross:
“Mars isn’t just a workforce or an export hub. It’s a symbol of humanity’s resilience. If we abandon them entirely, we send a message to every colony that Earth doesn’t care about its own. That’s a dangerous precedent.”

Calder raised an eyebrow, his tone sharp.

Calder:
“And what would you propose, Cross? Increased investments? We’re already stretched thin propping up their infrastructure.”

Cross:
“Reevaluate their terraforming projects. Allocate resources where they’re most needed—food production, medical advancements. If we’re strategic, we can stabilize Mars without bleeding Earth dry.”

The FTL Question

The conversation shifted to a more contentious topic. Calder tapped on his tablet, displaying projections for FTL advancements.

Calder:
“Let’s move to FTL development. The latest projections from Terragene suggest that Mars could develop its own prototypes within a decade. If they succeed, it would undermine Earth’s control over interplanetary trade.”

Hensleigh’s fingernails drummed on the table.

Hensleigh:
“We sabotage it. Quietly. Leak faulty schematics, disrupt supply lines, fund opposition within their government. Mars is a colony, not a competitor.”

Cross’s eyes narrowed, but she stayed silent for the moment. Clara’s pulse quickened as she absorbed the implications. FTL was humanity’s best hope for survival beyond the solar system, yet these people viewed it as a threat.

Thorne shifted uncomfortably.

Thorne:
“That’s a risky move. If Mars catches wind of Earth sabotaging their progress, it’ll push them closer to the Belt. And the Belt has no qualms about breaking Earth’s monopolies.”

Calder’s response was icy.

Calder:
“Then we ensure they never find out. This isn’t about Mars or the Belt. It’s about maintaining order.”

A Whisper of Rebellion

During the recess, Clara stepped into the hallway, her mind racing. She found herself face-to-face with Angela Cross, who offered a faint smile.

Cross:
“Heavy room, isn’t it?”

Clara hesitated, then nodded. Clara:
“Do you think Mars has a chance?”

Cross’s expression softened. Cross:
“Mars has always had a chance. The question is whether Earth will let them take it.”

Before Clara could respond, Cross’s assistant appeared, signaling her return to the boardroom. Clara was left alone, the weight of her disillusionment pressing harder with every passing moment.

A Decision Made

That night, Clara sat in her apartment, the city lights casting long shadows on her walls. On her tablet, she reviewed a confidential file detailing the next shipment to Mars. It included critical components for the terraforming project—components that EarthFirst planned to reroute to the Belt instead.

Clara’s finger hovered over the “Send” button. If she leaked the file to Mars’ leadership, they’d have a chance to secure the shipment and keep the project alive. But if she was caught, her career—her life—would be over.

Taking a deep breath, she pressed the button.

The Fallout

Days later, the shipment arrived on Mars. It was a small victory, a single spark of hope in a darkening world. Clara watched the news feed as Martian officials celebrated the unexpected delivery. She felt a pang of pride but also fear. She knew the corporate board would be furious when they discovered the leak.

Back in the boardroom, Calder’s voice boomed. Calder:
“We have a mole. Find them. Make an example of them.”

Clara kept her head down, her heart pounding. For now, she was safe. But she knew this was just the beginning of her quiet rebellion against Earth’s cold indifference.
