The Belt’s Recruitment Drive

275 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars was a planet on the brink, its cities hollowed out by years of declining population and dwindling resources. The once-grand terraforming projects had slowed to a crawl, their funding siphoned off by desperate survival efforts. Amid the collapse, the Belt colonies, thriving on the wealth of asteroid mining, saw an opportunity. They extended an enticing hand to Mars’ best and brightest: leave behind a dying world and join the thriving frontier among the asteroids.

An Offer Too Good to Ignore

Liora Voss sat in her cramped apartment in Helios City, one of Mars’ older domed settlements. Outside, the artificial lights of the biodomes flickered, a constant reminder of the city’s failing infrastructure. On her workbench lay a holographic projection from BeltCorp Industries, its sleek interface promising a better life.

“Liora Voss,” the message intoned in a polished, corporate tone, “We recognize your expertise in environmental engineering and oxygen recycling systems. The Belt needs skilled professionals like you. Join us, and you’ll enjoy competitive pay, cutting-edge facilities, and the chance to shape humanity’s future.”

The terms were generous: free transport to the Belt, housing in a state-of-the-art habitat, and a salary triple what she earned on Mars. But as enticing as the offer was, Liora’s gaze drifted to the framed photo on her wall. It showed her family: her parents, who had spent their lives working the algae farms, and her younger brother, who still dreamed of rebuilding Mars.

A Meeting of Motives

That evening, Liora joined a group of her colleagues at a local café, the air thick with dust and frustration. The topic was unavoidable: BeltCorp’s recruitment drive.

“They’re vultures,” muttered Amir Khalid, a fellow engineer. “Swooping in to pluck what’s left of Mars while we’re down.”

“Can you blame them?” countered Juno Elara, a technician who had already accepted an offer. “We’re barely scraping by here. The Belt has resources, stability, and a future. Staying on Mars is a dead end.”

Liora’s voice was measured but firm. “And if everyone leaves, what happens to Mars? Who’s going to fix the oxygen systems or maintain the farms? It’s not just about us—it’s about what we leave behind.”

Juno shrugged. “What’s left to save? This planet’s already gone.”

The conversation dissolved into uneasy silence, each person grappling with their own calculus of hope and despair.

A Revelation in the Archives

Later that night, Liora found herself in the city’s central archives, a sprawling data repository buried beneath layers of Martian rock. She’d come seeking solace in the records of Mars’ glory days, but what she found instead stopped her cold.

Buried in the archives was a report on BeltCorp’s resource allocations. The Belt colonies were hoarding vast quantities of water ice, oxygen reserves, and agricultural supplies. These were resources that could stabilize Mars’ infrastructure and give the planet a fighting chance.

Liora’s heart pounded as she realized the implications. The Belt wasn’t just recruiting Martian talent—it was actively ensuring Mars’ decline by withholding the very resources it needed to survive.

A Moral Crossroads

The next morning, Liora received a follow-up call from a BeltCorp representative. The man’s face was friendly, his demeanor warm, but his words carried the weight of an ultimatum.

“Ms. Voss, we’re finalizing our recruitment roster. If you’re ready to accept, we’ll handle all the arrangements. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

Liora’s response caught him off guard. “Does the Belt have plans to share its surplus resources with Mars?”

The man’s smile faltered. “Our focus is on ensuring the sustainability of our own colonies. Mars… has its own challenges to address.”

“Challenges the Belt could help solve,” Liora pressed. “Instead, you’re exploiting them.”

His tone turned icy. “If you’re not interested in the position, Ms. Voss, there are plenty of others who are.”

As the call ended, Liora felt the weight of her decision pressing down on her. Joining the Belt would mean safety and prosperity for herself, but it would also mean abandoning Mars to its fate.

The Farewell Ceremony

The next week, Liora organized a public gathering in Helios City’s central square. It was a farewell ceremony for those leaving Mars, a chance for the community to say goodbye and reflect on what was being lost.

Hundreds attended, filling the square with a mixture of sorrow and resolve. Liora stood on a makeshift stage, her voice steady despite the tears glistening in her eyes.

“Mars was never easy,” she began. “But it was ours. Every dome, every farm, every breath we take—it’s a testament to the sacrifices of those who came before us. If you’re leaving, I understand. But know this: Mars still has a future, if we choose to fight for it.”

The crowd’s reaction was mixed. Some cheered, others wept, and a few turned away, unable to face the pain of their decision. By the end of the ceremony, Liora knew she’d done all she could.

A New Path Forward

In the days that followed, Liora made her choice. She declined the BeltCorp offer, instead dedicating herself to repairing Mars’ infrastructure and rallying those who shared her vision. Her decision sparked a small but determined movement to preserve Mars’ legacy, a flicker of hope in the red dust.

The Belt continued its recruitment drive, and many Martians left for a brighter future among the asteroids. But for Liora and those who stayed, the fight for Mars was far from over. They knew the odds were against them, but they also knew that some things were worth fighting for.
