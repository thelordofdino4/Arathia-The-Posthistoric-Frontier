The Cry of the Red Dust

275 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars’ once-hopeful horizons stretched endless and barren, painted in muted shades of ochre and rust beneath a pale, alien sky. The faint hum of distant life-support domes dotted the desolation, reminders of a dream slowly crumbling into the dust. Among these vestiges of human ambition walked Jarek Allun, a retired miner with a weathered face and a slow, steady gait. His footsteps left faint impressions in the red dunes, only to be erased by the whisper of Martian winds.

Jarek had lived through Mars’ golden years—if they could be called that. He had toiled in the mines, carving out ice and iron beneath the planet’s surface. He had watched the domed cities rise with promises of prosperity and freedom from Earth’s decline. But those promises had withered as resources dwindled and populations stagnated. Now, Mars was a world of ghosts, its inhabitants clinging to life within failing infrastructure and dreams grown bitter with age.

A Miner’s Walk

Every morning, Jarek set out from his modest dwelling on the edge of Colony Tharsis, a settlement once hailed as the heart of Martian industry. He walked not out of necessity but out of habit, tracing paths through the red dust that had become his confessional. The dunes listened without judgment as he recited the memories of his youth—of comrades lost to mining accidents, of celebrations under the artificial glow of biodomes, of a time when the air seemed thick with hope despite its thin reality.

One day, his route took him past a collapsed dome, its skeletal frame jutting out like the ribcage of a long-dead beast. Children played among the ruins, their laughter incongruous with the starkness of the scene. Jarek paused, leaning on his walking stick, and called out to them.

“You know what this used to be?” he asked, his voice gruff but kind.

They shook their heads, curiosity lighting their faces.

“It was a market,” he said, gesturing to the debris. “The best fruits and grains you could find on Mars. People came from all over to trade. Now look at it. Dust and rubble.”

One of the children, a girl with wide eyes, asked, “Why did it stop?”

Jarek’s answer was slow, deliberate. “Because we forgot what we were building for. We were too busy digging and trading to remember why we came here in the first place.”

The children soon wandered off, their attention drawn elsewhere, but Jarek lingered. The girl’s question echoed in his mind long after the sun dipped below the horizon.

The Call to Remember

That evening, Jarek sat at his old workstation, a relic from his mining days. He activated the recorder embedded in the desk and began to speak, his voice heavy with both weariness and resolve.

“To anyone who will listen,” he began. “Mars wasn’t supposed to be like this. We came here to build something new, something better. But somewhere along the way, we let it slip through our fingers. Our domes are falling apart, our fields are running dry, and our people are leaving for the Belt or Earth’s last scraps. We’ve forgotten who we are.”

He paused, his fingers tracing the grain of the desk. “But it doesn’t have to end this way. We still have stories to tell, culture to preserve, and a legacy worth saving. If we can’t fix everything, we can at least hold on to what matters. For those who stay. For those who might come back.”

He sent the message to the colony’s central network, not expecting much. But within days, responses trickled in. Miners, engineers, teachers, and farmers—all shared their own memories of Mars, their frustrations, their hopes. Jarek’s words had struck a chord.

The Farewell Ceremony

Inspired by the flood of stories, Jarek organized a gathering at the old Tharsis amphitheater, one of the few structures still intact. Word spread quickly, and on the appointed day, hundreds of Martians braved the thin, cold air to attend. The amphitheater, though crumbling, echoed with voices for the first time in years.

Jarek stood at the center, his weathered features illuminated by the pale light of a makeshift projector. Behind him, images of Mars’ history played: the first settlers breaking ground, the domes rising against the horizon, the bustling markets and festivals of a bygone era.

“This isn’t a funeral,” he said, his voice steady but firm. “This is a reminder. Mars is still alive. Not just in these domes, but in us. In the stories we tell, in the work we do, in the way we endure. We may be few, but we are still here. And as long as we’re here, Mars lives.”

The crowd erupted into applause, their voices carrying across the amphitheater. For a moment, the weight of their struggles lifted, replaced by a collective determination to hold on, to remember, to persevere.

A Fragile Hope

The ceremony became a turning point for Tharsis and the surrounding colonies. Jarek’s message of resilience spread beyond Mars, reaching the Belt and even Earth. Aid shipments, modest but meaningful, began to arrive, spurred by the renewed interest in preserving Martian culture.

Jarek continued his walks, his footsteps tracing paths through the red dust. But now, he walked with a sense of purpose, knowing that his words had given his people something more valuable than resources or technology. He had given them hope.

Above, the stars shone cold and distant, but to Jarek, they seemed a little brighter. Mars, though battered and broken, still had a future—and he would walk its red dunes for as long as his legs would carry him, knowing he had played a part in keeping its flame alive.
