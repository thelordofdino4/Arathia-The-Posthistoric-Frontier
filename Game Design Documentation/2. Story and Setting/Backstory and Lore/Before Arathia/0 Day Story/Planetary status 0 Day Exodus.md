Earth: The Cradle’s Final Chapter
0 Day (Project Exodus)

By the time of Project Exodus, Earth is a decimated world, with over 99% of complex species extinct and ecosystems reliant entirely on artificial management. The planet’s once-thriving biosphere is gone, leaving behind a toxic and inhospitable wasteland. Humanity’s remnants are concentrated in evacuation hubs under the control of the One-World Government, which directs the final stages of off-world migration.

Population: Approximately 13 million, confined to evacuation hubs and artificial reserves.
Presence of Liquid Water: Derived solely from desalination plants and tightly rationed freshwater reservoirs; natural water sources are nonviable due to extreme contamination.
Chemical Environment: Toxicity permeates the soil, air, and water, rendering survival outside managed zones impossible.
Energy Sources: Solar and nuclear power sustain essential systems, prioritized for evacuation infrastructure.
Physical Conditions: Uninhabitable outside controlled zones; landscapes dominated by desertification, flooding, and abandoned ruins.
Atmospheric Composition: Oxygen: 15%, Carbon Dioxide: 4.8%, Nitrogen: 75%.
Climate Stability: Catastrophically unstable, with superstorms and erratic temperature extremes.
Radiation Protection: Minimal; the critically depleted ozone layer allows dangerous UV radiation levels.
Geophysical Stability: Weakened by centuries of exploitation, with frequent localized collapses.
Ecosystem Support: Artificial reserves and gene banks preserve the final remnants of biodiversity; natural ecosystems are extinct.
Economic Indicators: Irrelevant; all resources are centrally controlled and allocated for survival and evacuation.
Military Capabilities: Fully militarized under the OWG, tasked with maintaining order and securing Project Exodus operations.
Geographical Factors: Coastal areas submerged, urban centers abandoned, and fertile regions desertified.
Demographics: Skewed older, with younger generations prioritized for evacuation and off-world roles.
Technological Development: Focused exclusively on advanced spacefaring and life-support systems; terrestrial innovation has ceased.
International Relations: Irrelevant; OWG exercises total control over humanity.
Environmental Considerations: Abandoned; efforts focus solely on humanity’s off-world survival.
Magnetic Field: Weakening; inadequate protection against solar and cosmic radiation.
Geological Activity: Intensified by prior industrial activity, with unstable zones increasingly hazardous.

Mars: Humanity’s Refuge
0 Day (Project Exodus)

Mars stands as humanity’s primary sanctuary, with 30% of its surface now habitable through advanced terraforming. While fragile and reliant on technological intervention, the planet offers a livable environment where outdoor activity is possible in equatorial regions with minimal aid. Mars has become a beacon of hope and a critical hub for humanity’s survival and expansion.

Population: Approximately 100 million, with a focus on skilled professionals and growing families.
Presence of Liquid Water: Accessible through controlled aquifers, reservoirs, and ice extraction.
Chemical Environment: Breathable air in terraformed zones; unshielded areas remain hazardous.
Energy Sources: Solar, geothermal, and nuclear reactors ensure energy stability.
Physical Conditions: Habitable in equatorial regions and domed cities; extreme conditions persist in non-terraformed zones.
Atmospheric Composition (Terraformed Zones): Oxygen: 19%, Carbon Dioxide: 3%, Nitrogen: 78%.
Climate Stability: Moderately stable in terraformed regions, though thin atmosphere and radiation risks persist.
Radiation Protection: Magnetic shielding and advanced domes safeguard residents.
Geophysical Stability: Stable, supporting expansive infrastructure growth.
Ecosystem Support: Thriving artificial biomes and genetically engineered flora and fauna contribute to growing ecosystem resilience.
Economic Indicators: Developing self-sufficiency; Mars’ economy relies heavily on Belt resources.
Military Capabilities: Defensive forces focus on internal security and planetary defense.
Geographical Factors: Expansion centered on equatorial zones and resource-rich regions.
Demographics: Balanced population with high birth rates and emphasis on education and innovation.
Technological Development: Leading advancements in terraforming, sustainable systems, and interstellar logistics.
International Relations: Independent from the OWG; cooperative ties with the Belt dominate.
Environmental Considerations: Ecosystem resilience improves with terraforming progress.
Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety from radiation.
Geological Activity: Minimal, supporting continued infrastructure expansion.

The Belt: Humanity’s Industrial Lifeline
0 Day (Project Exodus)

The Asteroid Belt has evolved into humanity’s industrial powerhouse, providing the resources and energy needed to sustain Mars and construct the Exodus Fleet. Its dispersed network of advanced habitats and mining stations supports the largest human population in the solar system, marking the Belt as the cornerstone of humanity’s survival.

Population: Approximately 500 million, forming humanity’s largest settlement.
Presence of Liquid Water: Abundant from ice mining; water recycling achieves near-perfect efficiency.
Chemical Environment: Controlled habitat conditions ensure Earth-like living standards.
Energy Sources: Solar and fusion energy power Belt operations and exports.
Physical Conditions: Microgravity habitats present unique challenges but are well-managed.
Atmospheric Composition (Habitats): Oxygen: 21%, Nitrogen: 78%.
Climate Stability: Fully controlled within habitats, offering optimal living conditions.
Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety from cosmic radiation.
Geophysical Stability: Closely monitored mining operations prevent destabilization.
Ecosystem Support: Limited to artificial hydroponics and food production systems.
Economic Indicators: Thriving, with a focus on resource exports and Exodus construction.
Military Capabilities: Advanced security systems protect critical infrastructure.
Geographical Factors: Key hubs on Ceres, Vesta, and Psyche anchor trade and governance.
Demographics: Skilled, diverse workforce; strong emphasis on innovation and education.
Technological Development: Cutting-edge advancements in energy, mining, and logistics.
International Relations: Indispensable to Mars and OWG operations; strategic autonomy.
Magnetic Field: Artificial shields ensure habitat safety.
Geological Activity: Stable; mining operations carefully managed.
