Earth: The Cradle’s Final Chapter

0 Day (Project Exodus)

By the time of Project Exodus, Earth is a fragile and dying world. Its biosphere has collapsed, and over 99% of complex species are extinct. While a few artificial reserves and heavily managed areas maintain some biodiversity, the planet’s ecosystems are no longer self-sustaining. Urban centers are largely abandoned or have become hubs for evacuation operations under the control of the One-World Government.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 13 million, concentrated in controlled evacuation hubs.

Presence of Liquid Water: Limited. Remaining supplies are derived from desalination plants and tightly controlled freshwater reserves. Natural sources are largely unusable due to contamination.

Chemical Environment: Severely degraded. Atmospheric pollution and soil toxicity make survival outside managed zones impossible.

Energy Sources: Primarily solar and nuclear power, with energy strictly rationed to evacuation-related infrastructure.

Physical Conditions: Uninhabitable in most areas. Dust storms, desertification, and flooding dominate the landscape.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 15% (down from 21%)

Carbon Dioxide: 5%

Nitrogen: 75%

Climate Stability: Extremely volatile, with frequent superstorms, unseasonal temperature swings, and barren landscapes.

Radiation Protection: Minimal. The ozone layer has been critically depleted, exposing the surface to dangerous levels of UV radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Increasingly unstable due to extensive resource extraction and infrastructure decay.

Ecosystem Support: Collapsed. Artificial reserves and gene banks preserve the last remnants of Earth’s biodiversity.

Economic Indicators: Irrelevant. The OWG has replaced traditional economies with ration-based systems focused on survival and evacuation.

Military Capabilities: Centralized under the OWG, focused on maintaining order and safeguarding evacuation operations.

Geographical Factors: Coastal areas are submerged, and once-fertile regions are now barren or urbanized beyond recovery.

Demographics: Skewed older, with younger generations prioritized for off-world evacuation. Most remaining population consists of support staff for the Exodus project.

Technological Development: Advanced spacefaring technologies dominate, but terrestrial innovation has largely ceased.

International Relations: Irrelevant. The OWG holds absolute control over Earth’s population and resources.

Environmental Considerations: Abandoned. All resources are funneled toward space-based initiatives.

Magnetic Field: Weakening but still present, offering minimal protection from solar and cosmic radiation.

Geological Activity: Intensified by centuries of industrial exploitation.

Mars: Humanity’s Refuge

0 Day (Project Exodus)

Mars has become the primary bastion of human survival. Through extensive terraforming efforts, 30% of the planet’s surface is now habitable, albeit fragile and reliant on constant maintenance. Massive domed cities house the bulk of the population, while terraformed zones support limited outdoor activity.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 100 million, predominantly younger and skilled workers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Accessible through controlled aquifers and surface reservoirs derived from melted asteroid ice.

Chemical Environment: Controlled within domes, with marginally breathable conditions in select terraformed zones.

Energy Sources: Primarily solar and geothermal, supplemented by advanced nuclear reactors.

Physical Conditions: Habitable within domes and terraformed regions; harsh and unyielding elsewhere.

Atmospheric Composition (Terraformed Zones):

Oxygen: 19%

Carbon Dioxide: 3%

Nitrogen: 78%

Climate Stability: Improving, though weather remains challenging due to thin atmosphere and radiation exposure.

Radiation Protection: Magnetic shielding and domes protect residents from solar radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, though dust storms persist as a natural hazard.

Ecosystem Support: Artificial biomes and hydroponic farms sustain the population, with ongoing efforts to introduce genetically modified flora and fauna seeing success on equatorial regions.

Economic Indicators: Developing. A resource-based economy tied to the Asteroid Belt and Earth evacuees.

Military Capabilities: Focused on maintaining internal security and defending against potential Belt or Earth conflicts.

Geographical Factors: Expanding habitable zones, centered around Valles Marineris and other key regions.

Demographics: Predominantly young professionals, with high birth rates encouraged to maintain growth.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge, particularly in terraforming, life support, and renewable energy.

International Relations: Independent from the OWG. Mars has not been under Earth's control since before the fall of nations.

Environmental Considerations: Progressing. Ecosystem stability remains fragile but promising.

Magnetic Field: Localized magnetic shields provide sufficient protection.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring safety for infrastructure development.

The Belt: Humanity’s Industrial Lifeline

0 Day (Project Exodus)

The Asteroid Belt has matured into a thriving network of industrial hubs. These facilities extract and process the resources necessary for Mars’ development and the Exodus fleet, making the Belt the cornerstone of humanity’s off-world infrastructure.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 500 million, surpassing the combined populations of Earth and Mars, forming the largest human settlement area in the solar system.

Presence of Liquid Water: Derived from extensive water ice mining operations.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated within habitats, with Earth-like atmospheric conditions.

Energy Sources: Abundant solar and fusion energy power operations.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity environments present unique challenges but are well-managed.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%

Nitrogen: 78%

Climate Stability: Controlled within habitats, providing consistent living conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety from cosmic radiation.

Ecosystem Support: Limited to hydroponics and artificial food production systems.

Economic Indicators: Thriving. The Belt is an economic powerhouse, supplying essential materials for Mars and the Exodus fleet.

Military Capabilities: Strong defensive forces protect critical infrastructure from potential threats.

Geographical Factors: Dispersed across resource-rich asteroids, with major hubs on Ceres and Vesta.

Demographics: Highly skilled workforce, with a strong emphasis on training and education.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge advancements in mining, energy, and habitat design.

International Relations: Strategically indispensable to Mars and Earth’s survival efforts.

Magnetic Field: Artificial magnetic shielding protects habitats from radiation.

Geological Activity: Stable; mining operations carefully monitored to avoid risks.
