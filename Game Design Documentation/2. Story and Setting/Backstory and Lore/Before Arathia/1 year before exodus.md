### **Transcript of the Address**  

**President Levin:**  
*"My fellow citizens of Earth,*  

*Tonight, I speak not only as your president but as one of the last witnesses to the slow death of our world.*  

*For generations, humanity has fought against an unyielding tide. We have battled famine, disaster, collapse, and despair. We dreamed of reversing the damage, of restoring what was lost. But tonight, I must stand before you and declare the truth: our Earth, the cradle of our existence, can no longer support the weight of humanity.*  

*Let us not blame her. She bore us for millennia, nurturing life, granting us wonder, and enduring our worst. She weathered our wars, our greed, and our failures. But even the most resilient life must one day falter under endless strain. Today, we must face what so many already know in their hearts—this is the end of Earth as we knew her."*  

*(He pauses, letting the gravity of his words settle.)*  

*"We have tried everything. We preserved her legacy in genetic archives and monuments of memory. We attempted to reduce our presence, to give her time to heal. But the damage is too deep, and time has run out.*  

*For those of you who have stayed, I understand your hesitation. This is our home—our only home for so long. To leave it is to leave behind our history, our roots, our very identity. But I tell you this: Earth will not die completely. Her story is not over, but it is time for humanity to step aside.*  

*The Exodus Fleet represents hope. It represents the dreams of generations who refused to give up. It carries not just our people, but the knowledge and spirit of Earth. A thousand ships, ready to carry us to a hundred new worlds where life can begin again. Where humanity can thrive. Where we can honor Earth by learning from our mistakes."*  

*(His tone grows more determined, his voice unwavering.)*  

*"I know it is not easy. I know the thought of leaving fills many of you with fear. But staying is no longer an option. Those who remain will face a world that cannot sustain them. A world where survival will come at unbearable costs. I will not sugarcoat the truth: for those who stay, this is the end.*  

*But for those who leave, there is a chance. A chance to build anew. A chance to carry Earth’s memory to the stars. A chance to be the stewards of life, not its destroyers."*  

*(The camera pans over desolate landscapes outside as his voice softens, a faint glimmer of hope breaking through.)*  

*"To the people of deep space, to the colonies of Mars and Jupiter’s moons, to those waiting in the great ships—your courage has paved the way. You are the torchbearers of humanity’s future. As you leave, do not forget this world. Carry her beauty in your hearts. Remember the forests, the oceans, the endless skies. Remember what we were, and what we still can be.*  

*And to those who remain here, to witness Earth’s final days—I honor your choice. This is your home, and you will see her through to the end. You carry the greatest burden of all, but know this: your sacrifice will not be forgotten. Humanity will remember you as the guardians of our birthplace."*  

*(He steps back, a final, emotional pause before his closing words.)*  

*"My friends, tonight we say goodbye—not forever, but for now. One day, Earth will heal. One day, her skies will clear, her waters will run pure, and her soil will teem with life once more. When that day comes, humanity will return, not as conquerors, but as children coming home. Until then, let us honor her by surviving. Let us honor her by thriving. Let us honor her by leaving.*  

*Farewell, Earth. May we meet again."*  

*(The screen fades to black as the President steps away, the faint echo of his words lingering in the silence.)*
