One Year After the Fall of Nations: A Celebration of Corporate Dominance

The event was held in the penthouse conference hall of Helios Tower, Earth’s tallest remaining skyscraper. The room was opulent, its design carefully curated to reflect the immense power and wealth of its attendees. Golden accents gleamed under soft, ambient lighting, and walls of reinforced glass offered a panoramic view of Earth’s decaying cities below. The devastation only emphasized the importance of the gathering—a reminder of the triumph of those who had risen above it all.

Seated around a long, oval table were the new faces of Earth’s megacorporations, each one dressed in tailored suits that blended old-world sophistication with cutting-edge smart fabrics. At the head of the table sat Marcus Venn, the newly minted CEO of TerraGene Industries, flanked by Mara Kessler of Helios Corporation, Alaric Dent of Ascendant Logistics, and Soren Chastain of AetherCorp. These were the inheritors of the corporate empire, the successors to a generation of CEOs who had died or been replaced in the wake of Earth’s collapse.

Marcus raised a glass of imported Martian champagne, its bubbles catching the light in a way that made it seem otherworldly.

Marcus Venn: “Ladies and gentlemen, today marks a year since the fall of nations. One year since we put an end to the inefficiencies of sovereign governments and brought humanity under the rule of order and profit. Let’s toast to our success—to a future where progress is unbound by bureaucracy and sentimentality.”

The room echoed with polite clinks as glasses were raised. Mara Kessler leaned back in her chair, her smirk as sharp as the angles of her high-collared jacket.

Mara Kessler: “I must admit, Marcus, it’s been quite a ride. A year ago, I’d never have thought we’d be discussing the creation of corporate holidays. But here we are, debating whether Helios Day should come before or after AetherCorp Week.”

The table erupted in laughter, though Soren Chastain’s chuckle was more restrained. He tapped his glass thoughtfully against the table, its faint ring drawing the room’s attention.

Soren Chastain: “Amusing, yes. But let’s not lose sight of the reality below us. These celebrations will mean little if the workers don’t have something to aspire to. They need their illusions. Without hope, even manufactured hope, they’ll falter.”

Alaric Dent, a man known for his gruff demeanor, rolled his eyes.

Alaric Dent: “Hope? Soren, this isn’t a charity. They work because they must. We provide the means for survival; that’s all the incentive they need. If we’re giving them a show, it’s for our own amusement, not theirs.”

Marcus’s smile tightened as he interjected, his tone measured.

Marcus Venn: “While I respect your pragmatism, Alaric, Soren does raise a point. Our dominance relies on stability. The workers may not need hope, but they do need the illusion of purpose. Perhaps corporate holidays aren’t such a frivolous idea after all.”

Mara raised her glass again, her eyes glinting with mischief.

Mara Kessler: “Fine, Marcus. How about this? A week for each of us. Helios Day can kick off the festivities, naturally. AetherCorp’s Tech Triumph Day can close it. Ascendant’s Logistics Celebration can fall somewhere in between. And TerraGene’s... hmm... what would we call it? Genetic Advancement Gala?”

The group chuckled, and Marcus’s demeanor softened slightly, though his voice carried an edge of command.

Marcus Venn: “TerraGene Week of Life, actually. A celebration of our continued efforts to sustain humanity—even if they’re a bit oblivious to the irony of it all.”

Alaric’s laugh was loudest.

Alaric Dent: “I’ll drink to that. Here’s to keeping them alive just enough to keep the machines running.”

The toast felt darker this time, the laughter tinged with an unspoken acknowledgment of their precarious dominion. Mara’s gaze drifted to the view outside, the haze of pollution softening the jagged remains of a once-thriving world.

Mara Kessler: “We joke, but there’s truth in it. The world below isn’t going to hold much longer. Mars and the Belt are the future, not Earth. These holidays we’re debating might be the last things tying us to this place.”

Soren’s eyes narrowed, his voice calm but deliberate.

Soren Chastain: “Then perhaps our focus should be on legacy. Not just for us, but for the corporations themselves. Holidays, symbols, rituals... they’re not just for workers. They’re for history. To remind those who come after who truly shaped humanity’s destiny.”

Marcus nodded, his expression thoughtful.

Marcus Venn: “Agreed. We’ll frame it not as a celebration of power, but as an acknowledgment of responsibility. A corporate Age of Enlightenment, if you will.”

The others exchanged looks, some amused, others contemplative. The meeting concluded shortly after, with the executives returning to their separate domains, their egos soothed and ambitions sharpened.

Below them, the remnants of nations lay quiet, their people struggling to remember flags that no longer flew. Above, the corporate elite toasted to their victory, oblivious to the seeds of resistance already beginning to take root.
