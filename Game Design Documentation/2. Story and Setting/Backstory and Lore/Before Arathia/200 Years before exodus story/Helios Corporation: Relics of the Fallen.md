Helios Corporation: Relics of the Fallen

200 Years Before Project Exodus

The private lounge on Helios Corporation’s orbital headquarters was a cathedral of luxury. Plush seating crafted from faux leather, polished surfaces shimmering with embedded LED patterns, and a sweeping view of the Earth below, now a patchwork of scars and smog. Two executives, dressed impeccably in tailored suits, lounged in this oasis of opulence. They weren’t discussing quarterly earnings or population logistics. Today, the topic was a bit more... whimsical.

Nathaniel Hargrove, a rotund man with an overabundance of confidence, leaned back in his chair, holding up a coffee mug with a garish bald eagle emblazoned on the side. The words "#1 Freedom Country" were printed in bold, fading letters beneath the eagle.

Nathaniel: “Now this, my dear Natalie, is a true piece of history. Genuine, pre-collapse Americana. Can you believe people used to drink out of this?”

Natalie Shore, slender and sharp-eyed, smirked as she sipped her drink from a dainty porcelain teacup painted with the maple leaf of Canada.

Natalie: “Oh, Nathaniel, that’s charming. Nothing says ‘superpower’ like bad clip art. But check this out.”

She reached into a polished display case nearby and pulled out a bumper sticker sealed in a clear, protective casing. The text read: “Keep Australia Weird.” Beneath it was an illustration of a kangaroo surfing on a wave of fire.

Natalie: “They used to slap these on vehicles like badges of honor. Can you imagine? A world where people flaunted personal opinions on metal boxes.”

Nathaniel’s laugh boomed through the room.

Nathaniel: “Ah, Australia. They barely lasted, what, thirty years into the corporate transition? But I suppose they were more creative with their decline. Have you seen the art they left behind? Speaking of which...”

He gestured to the wall, where a massive painting hung. It depicted a heroic scene of a cowboy riding a rocket over an apocalyptic desert. The title plaque read: Manifest Destiny 2.0: A Texan’s Journey.

Natalie: “Tasteful,” she said dryly. “How did you even acquire that?”

Nathaniel: “An auction. Some Belt miner thought it would fund their retirement. Pity they didn’t know its true value.”

Natalie rolled her eyes and placed her teacup on the table. She picked up another item from her own collection: a framed photo of Earth taken during the early days of space exploration. The image showed a pristine, blue-and-green planet, unscarred by the ravages of humanity.

Natalie: “This one’s a bit... sentimental. Before all this, before the fall of nations. Back when people still thought they had a chance to fix things.”

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly, but the moment passed quickly.

Nathaniel: “Ah, yes, the optimism of fools. Speaking of fools, I’ve got one more.”

He walked to a display cabinet and carefully removed a faded, tattered flag. The red and yellow stars of China were barely visible, worn down by time.

Nathaniel: “Behold! The last flag flown over Beijing before they signed their sovereignty away. A piece of history, right here in my hands. And to think, the Helios board bought the entire region for less than it cost to terraform Mars.”

Natalie smirked, though her eyes betrayed a hint of discomfort. She held up her own artifact: a preserved fast-food wrapper from the United States, bearing the slogan “Have it Your Way.”

Natalie: “A mantra they certainly took to heart, right up until the end.”

The two executives laughed, their voices echoing in the sterile room. Outside, Earth’s mottled surface spun slowly, a testament to their corporation’s dominance.

Nathaniel: “It’s fascinating, really. All this nationalism, all these symbols. They thought they could outlast the inevitable.”

Natalie: “And now, here we are. The curators of their hubris.”

They raised their glasses in a mock toast, the artifacts of a bygone era around them like trophies. Somewhere, far below on the Earth they mocked, the last remnants of those nations struggled to survive. But here, in the sanctuary of Helios Corporation, history was just another commodity to be bought, sold, and ridiculed.

Nathaniel: “To the good old days. When the world thought it could say no to progress.”

Natalie: “To progress.”

The room fell silent except for the faint hum of the station. Outside, the stars continued their eternal watch, indifferent to humanity’s follies and the relics left behind.
