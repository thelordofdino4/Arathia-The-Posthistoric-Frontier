Earth: A Planet Under Corporate Rule
200 Years Before Project Exodus

With the collapse of sovereign nations, Earth was entirely under the control of mega-corporations. These entities promised stability but implemented profit-driven policies that entrenched inequality and deepened ecological crises. Though the environmental degradation stabilized due to declining industrial activity, runaway CO2 emissions from abandoned fossil fuel infrastructure and deforestation caused atmospheric CO2 levels to rise to 1.5%. Earth's remaining 400 million inhabitants lived under harsh, corporately managed conditions, as humanity focused its resources on off-world expansion.

Population: Approximately 400 million, concentrated in corporate zones and isolated enclaves.
Presence of Liquid Water: Managed reservoirs and desalination plants meet basic needs. Rivers and lakes are dry or polluted beyond recovery.
Chemical Environment: Toxic levels of industrial pollutants in soil and air persist. Carbon Dioxide: 1.5%, driven by decaying infrastructure and environmental feedback loops.
Energy Sources: Predominantly nuclear and fusion energy; minimal renewable energy projects remain.
Physical Conditions: Stabilized but harsh; average global temperatures rise another 2°C.
Atmospheric Composition: Oxygen: 19.5%. Carbon Dioxide: 1.5%. Nitrogen: 78%.
Climate Stability: Unstable; regions experience frequent droughts, heatwaves, and storms.
Radiation Protection: Fragmented ozone layer results in significant UV radiation exposure in some regions.
Geophysical Stability: Stable; minimal resource extraction reduces seismic risks.
Ecosystem Support: 15% of species remain, mostly in artificial biomes or genetically engineered systems.
Economic Indicators: Corporate-dominated economy prioritizes off-world expansion; Earth’s economic activity stagnates.
Military Capabilities: Fully privatized corporate security forces dominate; traditional national militaries no longer exist.
Geographical Factors: Corporate enclaves dominate habitable zones; abandoned cities and wastelands cover most of the planet.
Demographics: Aging population with low birth rates; youth migration to Mars and orbital habitats accelerates Earth’s decline.
Technological Development: Focused on interstellar travel, AI, and space infrastructure; Earth-based innovation is minimal.
International Relations: None; corporations function as autonomous global powers.
Environmental Considerations: No restoration efforts; reliance on artificial systems to maintain basic livability.
Magnetic Field: Stable but insufficient; radiation exposure remains a concern in some areas.
Geological Activity: Minimal due to the abandonment of large-scale industrial resource extraction.

Mars: A Growing Interplanetary Hub
200 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars continued its growth as humanity’s stronghold, driven by improved terraforming techniques and a stable influx of skilled workers from Earth. With 15% of its surface now habitable, the Martian population reached 10 million, supported by expanding agriculture and advanced life-support systems. Mars became a hub of research, technological advancement, and cultural development, solidifying its status as humanity’s most successful colony.

Population: Approximately 10 million, with a balanced demographic and growing second-generation population.
Presence of Liquid Water: Expanding reservoirs and aquifers support human needs and agriculture.
Chemical Environment: Atmosphere outside domes remains CO2-dominated but shows slight progress in oxygenation.
Energy Sources: Fusion and nuclear power dominate; solar farms expand in equatorial regions.
Physical Conditions: Habitable zones sustain steady growth but remain fragile.
Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones): Oxygen: 21%. Nitrogen: 79%.
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled domed habitats; terraforming projects reduce reliance on domes.
Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety for surface settlements.
Geophysical Stability: Stable conditions; mining and construction are carefully regulated.
Ecosystem Support: Hydroponics and genetically engineered crops sustain the population.
Economic Indicators: Strong growth driven by exports and internal innovation.
Military Capabilities: Defensive forces focus on resource protection and colony security.
Geographical Factors: Expansion concentrated in equatorial regions; polar regions support resource extraction.
Demographics: Thriving population with balanced age distribution and strong educational institutions.
Technological Development: Advancements in terraforming, interstellar logistics, and life-support systems.
International Relations: Increased independence from Earth; strong partnerships with Belt stations.
Environmental Considerations: Sustainability prioritized to minimize ecological impact.
Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; artificial shielding mitigates radiation risks.
Geological Activity: Minimal; conditions support infrastructure expansion.

The Belt: Humanity’s Industrial Backbone
200 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt solidified its role as the industrial heart of humanity, with a population of 60 million driving innovation and interstellar expansion. Resource extraction and advanced manufacturing ensured the Belt’s prosperity, while its increasing autonomy from Earth marked a shift in political and economic dynamics.

Population: Approximately 60 million, fueled by Earth migration and economic opportunities.
Presence of Liquid Water: Ice mining sustains habitats; advanced recycling systems enhance efficiency.
Chemical Environment: Controlled conditions within habitats ensure optimal livability.
Energy Sources: Fusion and solar energy dominate; experimental antimatter projects gain traction.
Physical Conditions: Microgravity managed by rotating habitats and health innovations.
Atmospheric Composition (Habitats): Oxygen: 21%. Nitrogen: 79%.
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled habitats provide ideal conditions.
Radiation Protection: Comprehensive shielding integrated into infrastructure.
Geophysical Stability: Mining operations adhere to strict safety standards.
Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponic systems sustain limited biodiversity.
Economic Indicators: Booming economy driven by innovation and resource exports.
Military Capabilities: Advanced corporate security forces deter external threats and maintain order.
Geographical Factors: Major hubs include Ceres, Psyche, and Vesta, serving as trade and governance centers.
Demographics: Diverse, skilled workforce with strong research and innovation sectors.
Technological Development: Leading advancements in AI, logistics, and interstellar transport.
International Relations: Increasing autonomy sparks tension with Earth-based corporations.
Environmental Considerations: Sustainable practices ensure long-term viability.
Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety within habitats.
