The Final Fall: A Special Report on Earth’s Last Nations

Broadcast from Martian News Network (MNN)

[Opening Scene: A striking image of Earth, a swirling blue and green orb now marred by sprawling megacities, surrounded by industrial smog. The camera pans to the Martian landscape, contrasting Earth’s chaos with the red planet’s stark serenity.]

Anchor: “Good evening, viewers. Tonight, we bring you an unprecedented and somber development: the last sovereign nations of Earth have officially fallen, absorbed into the vast machinery of the mega-corporations. This marks a monumental and troubling shift in humanity’s history, leaving the cradle of civilization without any form of independent governance.”

[The screen transitions to a Martian news studio. The anchor, a composed yet visibly concerned figure, addresses the audience.]

Anchor: “For context, this historic moment has been centuries in the making. Nations, weakened by decades of ecological disaster and social unrest, became increasingly dependent on corporate support. Now, even the most resilient holdouts have surrendered. Megacorporations like TerraGene Industries, Orbital Dynamics Corporation, and Helios Enterprises now control every inch of Earth’s surface.”

[The broadcast shifts to a reporter standing in front of a towering biodome on Mars. Crowds of Martians, some carrying protest signs, march in the background. The reporter begins her segment.]

Reporter: “Here on Mars, the reaction has been one of outrage and sorrow. Many Martians, especially those whose families emigrated from Earth, see this as the ultimate betrayal by corporate powers. I spoke with residents of Olympus City earlier today. Let’s hear their thoughts.”

[The screen cuts to interviews with Martian citizens.]

Martian Resident 1: (Middle-aged man, arms crossed) “It’s disgusting. Earth raised us, nurtured us, and now it’s being sold piece by piece. What’s left for the people who still live there? They’re just cogs in the corporate machine.”

Martian Resident 2: (Younger woman, holding a protest sign reading “Earth’s People Matter!”) “We left Earth because we wanted a better life, but we didn’t abandon the people there. How can they survive without a voice? Who’s protecting them now?”

[The broadcast returns to the reporter.]

Reporter: “We attempted to contact Earth for a statement on these events. Communications with major corporate entities, including TerraGene Industries and Helios Enterprises, were met with silence. Furthermore, when we requested permission to send a team to Earth for on-the-ground reporting, entry was flatly denied.”

[The screen cuts to a statement issued by Orbital Dynamics Corporation, the text scrolling slowly across the screen.]

Statement from Orbital Dynamics Corporation:
“The transition of governance on Earth is a necessary step toward global stability and progress. We urge all concerned parties to trust in the capabilities of our corporate leadership to secure a brighter future for humanity.”

Reporter (Voiceover): “The Belt’s reaction has been equally charged. Here’s what we heard from residents of Ceres Station.”

[The screen shifts to the asteroid belt, showing bustling industrial outposts juxtaposed with massive mining rigs. Residents of Ceres Station, many clad in work uniforms, speak to the camera.]

Belt Miner 1: (Gruff older man) “They’ve taken everything. Earth doesn’t belong to people anymore; it belongs to the highest bidder. This is just another reminder that the corporations will chew us all up if we let ‘em.”

Belt Technician: (Young woman, with oil-streaked overalls) “We’re next, aren’t we? If Earth couldn’t fight back, what chance do we have? Maybe it’s time for us to start building something new, something that isn’t about profits.”

[Back in the studio, the anchor solemnly addresses the audience.]

Anchor: “These are difficult times, not just for those on Earth but for all of humanity. The collapse of nations is more than just a political or economic event—it’s a cultural and moral reckoning. What does it mean to be human when profit governs every aspect of our existence?”

[The broadcast cuts to a closing image of Earth, the camera zooming in on its surface where corporate logos illuminate the night like stars.]

Anchor: “For now, we’ll continue to report on the repercussions of this historic moment. From Mars to the Belt, from the depths of space to the heart of humanity, we are united by one question: where do we go from here? This is Martian News Network, signing off.”

[The screen fades to black, leaving only the soft hum of static before the broadcast ends.]
