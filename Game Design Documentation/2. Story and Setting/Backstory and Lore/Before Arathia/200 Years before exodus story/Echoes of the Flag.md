Echoes of the Flag

200 Years Before Project Exodus

The city of Lyonesse stood as one of the last bastions of sovereign governance on Earth. Towering buildings of glass and steel reflected the crimson hues of a dying sunset, and the streets below bustled with life—street vendors, families, and workers weaving through the chaos of a world on the brink. To a child like Niko, the city was a place of endless wonder, its crowded markets and colorful murals bursting with life and hope.

Childhood in Lyonesse

Niko often accompanied their father to the city square, where a colossal flagpole rose above the bustle. At its peak flew the flag of Lyonesse: a deep blue field with a golden starburst, symbolizing resilience and unity.

Father: “Remember, Niko. This flag isn’t just a piece of cloth. It’s a promise. No matter what happens, we stand together.”

Niko would nod, though they didn’t fully understand. To them, the flag was simply beautiful, its colors glowing brilliantly in the sunlight.

Days were spent chasing friends through narrow alleys, marveling at street performers, and dreaming of flying to the stars. The future felt limitless, as if Lyonesse itself was invincible.

The Fall of Sovereignty

But Lyonesse was not invincible. The cracks in its foundation began to show when food lines stretched longer, and once-busy factories fell silent. Corporate emissaries from AetherCorp and TerraGene Industries arrived, their polished suits and confident smiles masking their true intentions.

Niko was twelve when the city’s leaders made their final announcement. Standing on a hastily constructed stage beneath the golden flag, the president’s voice trembled.

President: “To secure the future of Lyonesse, we must entrust our governance to the corporate council. They have the resources to rebuild what we cannot.”

The crowd erupted. Shouts of anger and despair mixed with the distant wails of sirens. Niko clutched their father’s hand, their wide eyes searching his face for reassurance. He said nothing, his gaze fixed on the flag as it fluttered defiantly against the darkening sky.

The Corporate Era

Years passed, and the transformation of Lyonesse was swift and unrelenting. The flag was taken down, replaced by the sterile logo of AetherCorp, its sleek design devoid of meaning. Streets once adorned with murals were painted over with advertisements, and the vibrant markets became sterilized corporate outlets.

As Niko grew older, they saw the optimism of their childhood erode. Friends moved away, their families unable to survive under the crushing weight of corporate taxes. The square where the flag once stood became a controlled access zone, patrolled by drones and private security forces.

By the time Niko turned eighteen, they worked in a cramped office, processing logistics for shipments of resources extracted from Earth’s failing ecosystems. They rarely ventured outside, the once-bustling streets now quiet and subdued.

A Moment of Defiance

One evening, Niko’s terminal buzzed with an unusual notification. A storage facility scheduled for demolition had flagged an anomaly in its inventory: Historical Artifacts—Flag of Lyonesse.

Something stirred within Niko, a spark of the awe they had felt as a child. They made their way to the facility under the cover of darkness, slipping past distracted guards and outdated surveillance systems. In the corner of a dusty storage room, they found it: the flag, faded and torn, but unmistakably the same golden starburst on a blue field.

Tears blurred their vision as they clutched the fabric to their chest. It smelled of dust and decay, but to Niko, it was a piece of a world that had refused to die.

Carrying the Flame

Niko didn’t return to their apartment that night. Instead, they climbed to the top of an abandoned building overlooking the city. The stars above seemed distant and cold, yet they offered a sense of possibility.

They unfolded the flag, letting it catch the faint breeze. For a moment, they imagined the voices of the crowd in the square, their father’s steady hand on their shoulder, the promise of unity and resilience.

Niko (to themselves): “We stand together.”

The flag was carefully folded and hidden in their coat. Niko knew they couldn’t restore what was lost, but they could preserve its memory. Somewhere in the heart of Lyonesse, amidst the sterile corridors of corporate rule, a fragment of its soul remained alive.

And so, with the flag as their secret burden, Niko resolved to carry its promise forward, even if it was only for themselves.

Epilogue

The corporate logos shone brightly across Lyonesse, but in the shadows, small acts of defiance began to take root. Graffiti depicting the golden starburst appeared in alleyways, whispers of rebellion passed between workers, and Niko’s stolen artifact became a symbol of quiet resistance.

Though Lyonesse was no longer the city of Niko’s childhood, its spirit endured, hidden but unbroken, waiting for the day humanity might once again stand together.
