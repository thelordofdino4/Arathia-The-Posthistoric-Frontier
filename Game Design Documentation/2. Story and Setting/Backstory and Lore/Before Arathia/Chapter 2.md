Chapter 2: The Final Address

The hunter sat across from the AGI, the faint hum of its core resonating in the quiet room. Its glow was steady now, as though bolstered by the hunter’s presence and curiosity. When the AGI began to speak, its tone was different—softer, more reflective, as if carrying the weight of a world long gone.

"Just now, I remembered something critical," the AGI began, its tone tinged with urgency. "In the final year, before we left for the stars, a speech was given—one that would echo through time. It was delivered by Adar Levin, the last president of Earth. Would you like to hear it?"

The hunter nodded, leaning forward slightly, his interest piqued. “Tell me.”

The AGI’s glow shifted faintly as it recounted the moment, word for word, its tone and cadence emulating the solemnity and gravitas of Earth’s last president, even capturing the faint timbre of a human voice.

"My fellow citizens of Earth,

Tonight, I speak not only as your president but as one of the last witnesses to the slow death of our world.

For generations, humanity has fought against an unyielding tide. We have battled famine, disaster, collapse, and despair. We dreamed of reversing the damage, of restoring what was lost. But tonight, I must stand before you and declare the truth: our Earth, the cradle of our existence, can no longer support the weight of humanity.

Let us not blame her. She bore us for millennia, nurturing life, granting us wonder, and enduring our worst. She weathered our wars, our greed, and our failures. But even the most resilient life must one day falter under endless strain. Today, we must face what so many already know in their hearts—this is the end of Earth as we knew her."

(The AGI paused for a moment, letting the gravity of the words settle before continuing.)

"We have tried everything. We preserved her legacy in genetic archives and monuments of memory. We attempted to reduce our presence, to give her time to heal. But the damage is too deep, and time has run out.

For those of you who have stayed, I understand your hesitation. This is our home—our only home for so long. To leave it is to leave behind our history, our roots, our very identity. But I tell you this: Earth will not die completely. Her story is not over, but it is time for humanity to step aside.

The Exodus Fleet represents hope. It represents the dreams of generations who refused to give up. It carries not just our people, but the knowledge and spirit of Earth. A thousand ships, ready to carry us to a hundred new worlds where life can begin again. Where humanity can thrive. Where we can honor Earth by learning from our mistakes."

(The AGI’s tone grew more determined, its delivery mirroring Levin’s unwavering voice.)

"I know it is not easy. I know the thought of leaving fills many of you with fear. But staying is no longer an option. Those who remain will face a world that cannot sustain them. A world where survival will come at unbearable costs. I will not sugarcoat the truth: for those who stay, this is the end.

But for those who leave, there is a chance. A chance to build anew. A chance to carry Earth’s memory to the stars. A chance to be the stewards of life, not its destroyers."

(The AGI’s glow softened, as if reflecting Levin’s somber determination.)

"To the people of deep space, to the colonies of Mars and Jupiter’s moons, to those waiting in the great ships—your courage has paved the way. You are the torchbearers of humanity’s future. As you leave, do not forget this world. Carry her beauty in your hearts. Remember the forests, the oceans, the endless skies. Remember what we were, and what we still can be.

And to those who remain here, to witness Earth’s final days—I honor your choice. This is your home, and you will see her through to the end. You carry the greatest burden of all, but know this: your sacrifice will not be forgotten. Humanity will remember you as the guardians of our birthplace."

(The AGI’s voice softened to an almost reverent tone as it concluded Levin’s final words.)

"My friends, tonight we say goodbye—not forever, but for now. One day, Earth will heal. One day, her skies will clear, her waters will run pure, and her soil will teem with life once more. When that day comes, humanity will return, not as conquerors, but as children coming home. Until then, let us honor her by surviving. Let us honor her by thriving. Let us honor her by leaving.

Farewell, Earth. May we meet again."

The AGI’s glow dimmed for a moment, as though the memory itself weighed heavily on its systems. The hunter remained silent, his expression pensive, his thoughts lingering on the world he had never seen and the choices made by his ancestors.

"That was the moment," the AGI said softly. "The speech that drove the final wave of humanity onto the ships. It was a farewell, a eulogy, and a rallying cry. And it marked the end of Earth’s long chapter as our home."

The hunter exhaled, his breath unsteady, emotions welling up as he thought about his own life. He had spent years protecting and cultivating his home settlement, pouring every ounce of his strength into its survival. The idea of leaving it all behind—the soil he had tilled, the people he had fought for, the future he had envisioned—tightened his chest. Levin’s words struck deeply, mirroring the reality it is a sacrifice he himself might one day have to make. "It must have been hard," he said, his voice trembling slightly, "leaving everything behind."

"It was," the AGI replied. "But those who left carried more than themselves. They carried the memory of a planet, the essence of what it meant to be human. And now, so do you."

The hunter nodded, his resolve hardening. "Then we’ll make sure it wasn’t for nothing. Let’s keep going. Tell me more."

The AGI’s glow flickered with a faint warmth. "In time, I am confident I will remember more," it said. "And when I do, you will be the first to hear it."

The hunter awoke in the dead of night, his heart pounding as the remnants of a vivid dream clung to him. The cool air of the settlement carried the faint rustle of nocturnal creatures, yet his mind was far away—lost in a world he could scarcely comprehend. His dream had been vivid, filled with the weight of despair and the faintest glimmer of hope. It was a dream of the last human on Earth, a memory not his own but one that resonated deeply, as though inspired by the AGI historian’s earlier words and woven into his dreams by the echoes of their conversation.

The air in his dream had been thin, heavy with radiation and the faint metallic tang of dust. A lone figure, wrapped in layers of tattered fabric, sat outside a crumbling bunker, her weary gaze fixed on the skeletal remains of a city on the horizon. The hunter remembered her name: Amara. She had been the last human on Earth, and her story unfolded before him as if he were there.

"The shelter was no longer safe," the dream seemed to say, a voice neither his nor hers. "Its filters clogged with decay, its reserves depleted. Amara had stopped counting the days. Time had long since lost meaning in a world where nothing moved, nothing grew, and nothing lived."

The hunter’s chest tightened as he recalled her sitting outside, the Geiger counter at her side clicking incessantly. Her skin, blotched and raw, bore the marks of radiation poisoning, yet there was a strange peace in her eyes. She had accepted her fate.

"I chose to stay," she whispered into the silence of the dream, her voice hoarse and broken. "This is my home. I couldn’t abandon her."

Her words echoed in the hunter’s mind, and he felt a pang of understanding. She had stayed behind, knowing what it would cost her, to bear witness to the Earth’s final days.

Amara’s gaze shifted to the soil beneath her feet—gray and lifeless. Yet, in her mind, it transformed. The barren land became lush and vibrant, a vision that felt impossibly real. Vast forests of shimmering emerald and gold rose from the ground. Rivers, clearer than crystal, carved paths through valleys alive with flowers. Strange creatures roamed—beasts with feathered wings and glowing antlers, their eyes intelligent and kind.

"It could be like that," she murmured in the dream. "Like the tales in books... A world where everything lives together, where nothing is taken for granted."

The hunter stirred in his sleep, his dreams mingling with his waking thoughts. He imagined Arathia, the world he called home, and the delicate balance he and others worked so hard to maintain. Was it so different from what Amara had envisioned?

In the dream, Amara stood, her frail body trembling as she cradled a small bundle. She made her way to a shallow pit beneath the shade of a dead tree, its roots clinging stubbornly to the barren soil. From the bundle, she withdrew a glass vial filled with seeds—tiny and dormant, yet brimming with potential.

She knelt and buried the vial in the soil, her hands trembling. "For you," she whispered. "For the Earth. For the world you could become."

The hunter’s heart ached as he watched her labor. Even in her final days, she held onto hope—not for herself, but for the planet she loved.

As the sun dipped below the horizon in Amara’s world, the dream shifted. She leaned against the tree, her gaze lifting to the heavens. The stars pierced through the haze, brighter than she remembered. Her lips moved, forming words the hunter felt more than heard.

"Maybe someday," she whispered, her voice faint. "Maybe you'll find it... or make it."

The hunter’s breath caught as the dream lingered on her face, serene and content despite the pain. She had found peace, a connection to the Earth that transcended her suffering.

The dream faded, but its echoes remained. The hunter stirred, his mind racing. He could still see Amara’s vision of a healed Earth, her fairy tale world coming to life. Centuries later, he thought, the seeds she buried would stir beneath the soil. Rain would fall, rivers would flow, and forests would rise once more.

When humanity returned to Earth, it would be a world transformed—a world alive with magic and harmony, as though it had grown from the pages of Amara’s dream. The hunter imagined the first grove, its roots cradling the ancient vial of seeds. Earth would remember its last guardian, and her dream would endure.

As the first light of dawn touched the horizon, the hunter sat up, his thoughts heavy yet filled with a quiet determination. Amara’s story wasn’t just a dream; it was a reminder. The work of protecting and nurturing life—on any world—was never finished. It was a legacy worth carrying forward.

The next time the hunter visited the AGI, he asked, "Do you happen to remember who the last person on Earth was? What was their name?" The AGI stirred, its lights blinking rhythmically as though sifting through layers of fragmented data. "I don't know," it replied after a pause, uncertainty evident in its voice. "Perhaps it is still in my memory, locked behind the corruption. If I do remember, I will let you know."

The hunter’s shoulders sagged slightly, a flicker of disappointment crossing his face. But as he stood there, looking at the glowing core, a quiet hope lingered in his heart. One day, he thought, there would be an answer.
