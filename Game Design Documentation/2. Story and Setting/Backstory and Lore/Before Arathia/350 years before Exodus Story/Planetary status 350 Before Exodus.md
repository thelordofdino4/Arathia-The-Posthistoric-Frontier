Earth: A Planet in Collapse
350 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth’s decline accelerates as the planet’s population drops to 900 million. Environmental degradation, resource scarcity, and socio-political fragmentation render much of the planet uninhabitable. Despite the groundbreaking invention of FTL technology offering hope for interstellar survival, Earth’s remaining population faces despair and inequality.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 900 million, concentrated in surviving enclaves amidst abandoned urban sprawl.

Presence of Liquid Water: Critically strained; widespread pollution renders much of it undrinkable without advanced filtration.

Chemical Environment: Oceans highly acidic; atmospheric CO2 levels dangerously high, accelerating global warming.

Energy Sources: Renewables and nuclear power sustain remaining infrastructure; fossil fuel use persists in fragmented territories.

Physical Conditions: Extreme heat, unrelenting storms, and rising sea levels continue to devastate habitable zones.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 19.5%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.09% (driving severe climate instability)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Nonexistent; disasters such as megastorms, droughts, and floods are constant.

Radiation Protection: The ozone layer suffers significant depletion in equatorial regions.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall; human activities exacerbate localized risks, including sinkholes and erosion.

Ecosystem Support: Less than 30% of species remain; ecosystems are fragmented and unsustainable.

Economic Indicators: Economies collapse; mega-corporations monopolize wealth and resources, leaving the majority impoverished.

Military Capabilities: Fragmented; remnants of national and corporate forces focus on resource protection.

Geographical Factors: Coastal regions are largely submerged; arid zones expand rapidly.

Demographics: Aging population; widespread displacement accelerates urban decline.

Technological Development: FTL travel marks a scientific renaissance, but advancements are unevenly distributed.

International Relations: Nonexistent; corporate and colony governance replace traditional state power.

Environmental Considerations: Neglected in favor of interstellar exploration.

Magnetic Field: Stable but irrelevant to worsening surface conditions.

Geological Activity: Normal but compounded by environmental mismanagement.

Mars: A Stagnant Colony
350 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars remains at its population cap of 4 million, unable to expand without significant technological breakthroughs. Dependency on the Belt and Earth for resources creates economic and political pressures, while the advent of FTL technology shifts focus toward interstellar exploration.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 4 million, with stagnating growth due to limited infrastructure.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable through subsurface ice extraction and aquifer management.

Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated atmosphere persists; breathable air confined to domes.

Energy Sources: Solar arrays and nuclear reactors meet basic needs but leave little room for expansion.

Physical Conditions: Domes remain crowded and resource-intensive to maintain.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Controlled within domes; terraforming efforts stalled by lack of resources.

Radiation Protection: Effective shielding protects settlers from cosmic radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; dust storms and subsidence remain concerns.

Ecosystem Support: Limited to hydroponics and controlled biomes; food imports remain necessary.

Economic Indicators: Stagnant; reliant on the Belt and Earth for critical supplies.

Military Capabilities: Minimal; corporate security focuses on internal stability and resource defense.

Geographical Factors: Habitable zones fully exploited; underground expansion remains constrained.

Demographics: Skilled but aging workforce; tensions rise over resource distribution.

Technological Development: Incremental improvements in life support; limited focus on innovation.

International Relations: Tensions with the Belt and Earth escalate over resource allocation.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainability prioritized but difficult to achieve.

Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; artificial shielding remains essential.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring construction stability.

The Belt: Humanity’s Industrial Core
350 Years Before Project Exodus

The Belt’s population surpasses 3 million as it becomes the primary supplier of resources for Earth and Mars. Innovations in mining and orbital construction continue, but social tensions and demands for autonomy grow as Belt residents assert their identity.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 3 million, spread across habitats and mining stations.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable supply from ice mining; supports both life and fuel production.

Chemical Environment: Fully controlled within habitats; Earth-like conditions maintained.

Energy Sources: Solar power dominates; experimental fusion reactors show promise.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity remains a challenge; health protocols improve living standards.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially regulated; habitats provide consistent living conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety from cosmic radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining operations carefully monitored to prevent structural risks.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farms expand but remain heavily reliant on Earth imports.

Economic Indicators: Wealth increases; corporations consolidate power over resource extraction.

Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces grow more powerful, protecting operations and enforcing order.

Geographical Factors: Expansion continues across resource-rich asteroids like Ceres and Vesta.

Demographics: Young and diverse workforce; growing number of permanent settlers.

Technological Development: Leading in resource extraction and orbital engineering; FTL capabilities begin integration.

International Relations: Push for autonomy intensifies; strained relations with Earth and Mars persist.

Environmental Considerations: Operations aim for efficiency and minimal failures.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety.

Geological Activity: Carefully managed to prevent mining accidents.

Beyond the Belt: The FTL Revolution
350 Years Before Project Exodus

The advent of FTL technology sparks a shift in humanity’s focus toward interstellar exploration. Probes reach distant star systems, identifying potentially habitable planets. This breakthrough redefines humanity’s ambitions but exacerbates inequalities and neglect for Earth-bound populations.

Key Points:

Population: Minimal; research stations established for FTL integration and testing.

Technological Milestones: Advanced warp field mechanics and antimatter energy systems accelerate colonization plans.

Resource Implications: Investment shifts toward exoplanet surveys and interstellar infrastructure.

Sociopolitical Impact: Deepening divides between those with access to interstellar opportunities and those left behind.
