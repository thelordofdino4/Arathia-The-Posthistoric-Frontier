The Martian sky loomed vast and crimson, a stark reminder of the alien world humanity now called home. Beneath the protective dome of Olympia’s Grand Auditorium, humanity’s leaders, scientists, and survivors gathered to honor the memory of Nora Vale. At 112 years old, she had passed away on Mars while advising the fragile and still-developing colony. Her presence on the red planet, far from Earth where she had once been a pivotal figure, spoke volumes about her enduring commitment to humanity's survival and progress.

The auditorium was filled to capacity. Transparent panels offered an unbroken view of Mars’ barren landscape, and the dome's interior glowed with soft, warm light. A towering holographic image of Nora Vale stood behind the podium, her wise and weathered face gazing resolutely forward—a figure frozen in time but still guiding those she had left behind.

Opening Remarks: Dominic Orlan
Dominic Orlan, Station Coordinator from Callisto and one of Nora's oldest allies, approached the podium. His shoulders were stooped with age, but his voice carried the strength of years spent alongside Nora in humanity’s struggle.

“When I heard Nora had passed, I found myself wondering what had brought her to Mars in her final years. After all, she was a woman of Earth—its tireless guardian, its most vocal advocate. But the truth is, she came here for the same reason she fought so hard back home. Nora believed in second chances. She believed in us—flawed as we are—and she believed in this fragile experiment of survival on Mars. She came here to help this colony find its footing, and she stayed because she saw hope.”

Eulogy: Elias Cormak
CEO of Terragene Industries

Elias Cormak, Nora’s occasional adversary turned ally in the later years of her life, stood next. His polished demeanor, honed through years of corporate leadership, softened as he began to speak.

“Nora Vale was never afraid to call me out. And let me tell you, she did so plenty of times. She reminded me—and many others—that no matter how far we’d come, there was still so much more to do. She forced us to face the truth when it was inconvenient and challenged us to do better, no matter the cost.

“When she came to Mars, she didn’t come to criticize. She came to build. She took the lessons she’d learned on Earth—the successes and the failures—and she poured them into this colony. She worked alongside scientists, engineers, and leaders, ensuring that Mars could be more than just a refuge. She wanted it to become a home.”

Elias paused, his voice thick with emotion. “Nora’s vision didn’t end with her. It lives in the soil of this planet, in every dome and biodome, in every life saved. It’s up to us now to honor her legacy, not by mourning, but by continuing her work.”

Eulogy: Admiral Leyton Vance
Defense Liaison, Earth and Mars Operations

Admiral Leyton Vance, a grizzled figure in his military uniform, approached the podium with slow, deliberate steps. His steely gaze softened as he looked out over the crowd.

“Nora Vale wasn’t just a leader. She was a force. I first met her during one of the darkest moments of Earth’s history. I was skeptical—back then, I thought no one could steer humanity back from the brink. But Nora… she made me believe. Not because she sugarcoated the truth, but because she confronted it head-on.

“When the Earth Reseeding Initiative fell apart, and when Mars was teetering on collapse, Nora kept us together. She didn’t see borders or factions. She saw humanity. She once told me, ‘Leyton, survival isn’t enough. We have to deserve survival.’ And I think about those words every day.”

The Admiral’s voice faltered briefly. “We’re here because of her. And if we want to honor her, we have to prove her right. We have to show that humanity can be more than what we’ve been.”

The Circumstances of Nora’s Final Years
Though Nora Vale had spent much of her life in leadership roles on Earth, she chose to relocate to Mars during her final years. By this point, her influence on Earth had waned due to the rise of corporate dominance and shifting global priorities. Yet on Mars, a struggling colony in desperate need of guidance, she found a new purpose.

Nora was instrumental in stabilizing Martian agriculture, improving resource management, and fostering cooperation between the colony and Earth. Her tireless efforts to support the fragile settlement made her a beloved figure among Martians, who saw her as both a mentor and a protector.

Her passing, though inevitable, was met with an outpouring of grief not just from Mars, but from every corner of the solar system.

Final Farewell
The procession carrying Nora’s ashes moved solemnly through the biodomes she had helped nurture. Her final request was to be interred beneath a tree in the Heart Dome, a towering pine genetically engineered to thrive in Mars’ thin atmosphere. This tree, like Nora, symbolized resilience and hope in the face of adversity.

As the urn was placed into the soil, Dominic Orlan spoke the final words of the ceremony.

“Nora Vale gave her life to humanity. She showed us that even in the face of impossible odds, we can endure. But endurance alone is not enough. We must thrive. We must honor her by learning, by growing, and by ensuring that the mistakes of the past never define our future.”

One by one, the mourners placed handfuls of soil over the urn, their gestures quiet but heavy with meaning. The tree’s branches swayed gently, as if touched by a breeze from another world.

Legacy
As the crowd dispersed, Nora’s final letter was transmitted across Earth, Mars, and the Belt:

“We are the stewards of life, not its masters. Remember that as you carry forward the work we have started. Protect what remains. Heal what is broken. And never forget the home we left behind.”

Even in death, Nora Vale’s voice resonated—a reminder of the lessons she had fought so hard to teach and a call to action for a humanity still struggling to prove itself worthy of survival.
