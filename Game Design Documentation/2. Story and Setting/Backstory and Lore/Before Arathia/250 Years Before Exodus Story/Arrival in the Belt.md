Arrival in the Belt

250 Years Before Project Exodus

The ship docked with a heavy metallic clang, its hull groaning against the artificial gravity of the Belt station. The SS Pioneer, like many others, was retrofitted for human cargo—not goods or ore—as Earth hemorrhaged its people into the cold void of space. Families like the Kianis, displaced and desperate, arrived in the Asteroid Belt seeking refuge in a place that had long been synonymous with mining and toil.

The Arrival

Lena Kiani stood with her daughter, Amara, clutching a tattered bag that held the last remnants of their life on Earth. Her husband, Idris, walked ahead, his shoulders hunched under the weight of exhaustion. The airlock hissed open, revealing a bustling interior that smelled of metal, oil, and recycled air. The station was a sprawling labyrinth of corridors and compartments, its walls lined with pipes and conduits humming with life support.

“This is home now,” Idris muttered, more to himself than to his family.

Amara tightened her grip on Lena’s hand, her wide eyes scanning the unfamiliar world. She was only ten, but her face bore an expression far too old for her years.

“Mama, will there be a sky?” she asked softly.

Lena hesitated before answering. “Not like Earth, my love. But we’ll have light and space to breathe. That’s what matters.”

A New Reality

The Kianis were guided to a communal intake area, where rows of newcomers sat clutching their meager belongings. A harried administrator approached, her tablet glowing with allocation assignments.

“Kiani family,” she said briskly. “You’re assigned to Habitat C, Section 14. Mining shifts will be assigned after orientation.”

Idris frowned. “Mining? I was an engineer on Earth. Surely—”

The administrator cut him off, her tone curt but not unkind. “Everyone works, Mr. Kiani. Engineers, miners, farmers. We’re stretched thin, and survival comes first. Welcome to the Belt.”

The Burden of Humanity

The walk to Habitat C was long and winding, the station’s industrial corridors amplifying every footstep. They passed through zones where machinery roared and workers toiled, their faces streaked with grime and determination. Children ran past, their laughter echoing incongruously against the backdrop of labor.

Lena watched Amara’s eyes linger on the workers. She wondered what her daughter saw: hope in their resilience or despair in their drudgery?

“This is a place to survive,” Idris said quietly. “Not to live.”

“But we have to try,” Lena replied. “For her.”

Amara, oblivious to the weight of her parents’ exchange, pressed her face against the plexiglass window of their assigned habitat. Beyond, the asteroids floated silently, jagged fragments of rock bathed in the distant glow of the sun.

Duty and Morality

The next day, Idris reported to his assigned sector, where a grizzled foreman handed him a mining exosuit and a dataslate outlining his tasks. The work was grueling, but Idris’ mind was elsewhere. He couldn’t stop thinking about the refugees still arriving in droves, many without the skills to contribute or the strength to endure.

During a break, he spoke to his supervisor.

“There’s a family in Habitat D,” Idris began. “The father’s sick, the mother’s struggling with two little ones. Can’t we spare more rations?”

The foreman shook his head. “We give them more, someone else gets less. That’s the math, Kiani. Fair’s got nothing to do with it.”

Idris clenched his fists but said nothing. The cold logic of survival had supplanted the morality that once guided humanity.

The Fragility of Hope

That evening, Lena sat in the small common area of their habitat, stitching a tear in Amara’s coat. Around her, families shared stories of Earth, clinging to memories as a lifeline.

“Do you think the stars care about us?” Amara asked suddenly.

Lena looked at her daughter, startled. “What do you mean, my love?”

“We left Earth because it was broken,” Amara said. “And now we’re here, but it doesn’t feel like home. Maybe the stars want us to keep moving.”

Lena felt a lump rise in her throat. She reached out, pulling Amara close.

“The stars don’t decide where we belong,” she said. “We do. And we’ll make this our home, together.”

A Glimmer of Unity

Over the weeks, the Kianis found small ways to carve out meaning in the Belt. Idris volunteered for double shifts to earn extra rations, which he shared with struggling neighbors. Lena organized a storytelling circle for children, weaving tales of Earth’s beauty to keep their imaginations alive. Amara, despite her young age, learned to tend the small hydroponic garden in their habitat.

Though life was harsh, the Kianis’ efforts inspired others to look beyond their own survival. In the cold, silent expanse of the Belt, humanity’s spark endured—fragile, but burning.

Above them, the stars continued their silent vigil, unyielding yet indifferent. The Kianis, like so many others, carried the weight of a species teetering on the edge, determined to find hope in the vastness of the void.
