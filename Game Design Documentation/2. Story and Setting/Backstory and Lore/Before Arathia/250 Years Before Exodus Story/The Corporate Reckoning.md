The Corporate Reckoning

250 Years Before Project Exodus

The boardroom was a cathedral of opulence. Polished steel walls reflected holographic displays of the Great Evacuation: thousands of shuttles lifting off from Earth’s surface, bound for orbital stations or colonies beyond. The members of Earth’s most powerful megacorporations sat in silence, their faces lit by the blue glow of statistics scrolling across the central table. Profits were cratering. Population losses on Earth, while inevitable, were happening at a scale and speed that threatened their stranglehold on human civilization.

Victoria Hensleigh, CEO of Orion Industries, broke the silence with a sharp tone, her frustration barely contained.

Hensleigh: “This exodus is unsustainable. Do you see these projections? Billions of potential customers, gone. Entire markets obliterated overnight. And why? Because of whispers and leaks...” She paused, her voice heavy with contempt. “...from Angela Cross and Clara Ainsworth.”

Nathaniel Greaves of Helios Industries leaned back, his expression grim.

Greaves: “Mars is recovering, slowly but undeniably. Terraforming operations are back on track, and their population decline is stabilizing. Meanwhile, Earth hemorrhages its workforce. That’s not a coincidence.”

Hensleigh: “Of course, it’s not. Those two have been sabotaging us for years, feeding information to every major outlet and ensuring those shuttles fly faster than we can manage damage control.”

The Leak

The discovery of Angela Cross and Clara Ainsworth’s alliance had sent shockwaves through the corporate elite. Both women had spent years methodically exposing the greed and failures of Earth’s megacorporations. Their data leaks painted a damning picture:

Mass Exodus Driven by Necessity: Clara’s leaks revealed the true extent of Earth’s ecological collapse, forcing governments and corporations to accelerate evacuation efforts. With nowhere left to hide, corporations had no choice but to repurpose resources for survival instead of profit.

The Mars Revival: Angela’s efforts to redirect resources to Mars’ terraforming operations had borne fruit. Her leaked schematics and supply routes ensured critical shipments reached the colonies, bypassing corporate red tape and sabotage attempts. Mars, once on the brink of collapse, had regained its footing—a beacon of hope for humanity.

Victoria Hensleigh’s fist slammed onto the table.

Hensleigh: “We should have shut them down the moment we suspected. Instead, we’ve let them undermine us at every turn. Now, the media hails them as heroes.”

Greaves: “Heroes don’t last long. We’ve survived worse disruptions than this. It’s time we reminded them who’s really in control.”

A Promising Threat

Later that evening, Angela Cross sat in her private residence on one of Mars’ most secure stations. The dome’s glass walls offered a breathtaking view of the rust-colored landscape, its horizon dotted with glimmers of the terraforming machinery she had fought so hard to protect.

Her communicator chimed. The name on the display froze her blood: Victoria Hensleigh. Angela hesitated but answered.

Hensleigh’s voice was smooth but venomous.

Hensleigh: “Angela, congratulations. You’ve made quite a name for yourself. Mars’ golden savior. How poetic.”

Angela: “If you’ve called to threaten me, Victoria, you’ll have to do better than this.”

Hensleigh laughed coldly.

Hensleigh: “Threats? No, Angela. Promises. The corporate hierarchy has no room for idealists like you and Clara. Your time’s up. Enjoy your little victories while they last.”

The call disconnected before Angela could respond. She stared at the screen, her mind racing. For years, she had known this moment would come, yet it still felt like a gut punch. She opened a secure channel and contacted Clara.

Clara Ainsworth’s voice crackled through the line.

Clara: “I take it you got the same call?”

Angela: “Hensleigh. She’s furious.”

Clara: “Good. That means we’re doing something right. Still, we’ll need to be careful. They’ll come after us, Angela. You know they will.”

Angela: “Let them try. They’re too late to stop what we’ve set in motion.”

The Boardroom Reprisal

The following day, Hensleigh convened a closed meeting with the heads of Helios Industries, Ascendant Logistics, and Terragene. The tension in the room was palpable.

Greaves: “We’ve already initiated steps to contain this. Cross and Ainsworth have burned their bridges within the hierarchy. By the time we’re through, they’ll be pariahs.”

Hensleigh: “Containment isn’t enough. We need to make an example of them. Their actions have cost us billions. They’ve emboldened Mars and destabilized our control over Earth’s evacuation process. We cannot allow this to stand.”

Evers of Ascendant Logistics spoke cautiously.

Evers: “And yet, despite everything, they’ve succeeded in rallying public support. Any direct action against them will be seen as retaliation. It’ll strengthen their cause.”

Hensleigh’s lips curled into a thin smile.

Hensleigh: “Then we ensure their fall looks like justice. We’ll expose their methods, paint them as reckless idealists who endangered humanity’s future. And when the time comes, we’ll offer solutions that align with our interests.”

The Endgame

As the corporations plotted, Angela and Clara prepared for the storm ahead. Angela’s gaze shifted back to the Martian horizon, her resolve unbroken.

Angela: “They think they can break us. They’re wrong. Humanity’s future doesn’t belong to them. Not anymore.”

Clara: “Then let’s make sure we finish what we started.”

In the shadows of Earth’s collapsing hierarchy and Mars’ fragile resurgence, the battle for humanity’s future continued—a struggle between greed and hope, power and resilience, and the indomitable spirit of those who dared to dream of a better world.
