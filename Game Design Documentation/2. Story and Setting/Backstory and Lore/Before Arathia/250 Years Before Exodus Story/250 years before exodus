# 250 Years Before Project Exodus: The Great Evacuation  

---

## **A Desperate Exodus from Earth**  

250 years before Project Exodus, Earth’s ecological collapse reached a critical point. With natural disasters, famine, and resource shortages making the planet increasingly uninhabitable, a massive effort known as **The Great Evacuation** began. Orbital stations and spacefaring infrastructure were repositioned to facilitate the evacuation of as many people as possible.  

Despite these efforts, Earth's population dropped to a mere **500 million**, marking a grim milestone in humanity’s retreat from its homeworld. Space habitats, Mars, and the Asteroid Belt became the primary destinations for those fortunate enough to escape, leaving behind a fractured and struggling population on Earth.

## **The Evacuation Effort**  

### **Repositioning Orbital Stations**  
To accommodate the mass exodus, major orbital habitats and stations were relocated closer to Earth:  
- **Purpose-Built Evacuation Ports**: Temporary spaceports were constructed in low Earth orbit (LEO) to ferry people off the surface.  
- **Cargo Conversion**: Many freighters originally designed for materials transport were retrofitted to carry passengers in cramped but functional conditions.  
- **Continuous Launch Operations**: Thousands of shuttles launched daily from Earth’s remaining urban centers to meet demand.  

### **Prioritization of Passengers**  
The evacuation was marked by difficult decisions about who could leave:  
- **Priority Groups**: Skilled workers, scientists, and individuals essential to off-world operations were prioritized.  
- **Corporate Influence**: Mega-corporations ensured their employees and families were among the first evacuees, sparking outrage among Earth’s population.  
- **Lottery System**: To appease public dissent, some spots were allocated via a global lottery, though the process was widely criticized as rigged.

## **Destinations for Evacuees**  

### **Space Habitats**  
Orbital habitats became the primary destination for evacuees:  
- **Expanding Capacity**: Existing stations in low Earth orbit and the Asteroid Belt were expanded to house millions of new arrivals.  
- **Cramped Living Conditions**: Life aboard these habitats was harsh, with overcrowding and rationing becoming the norm.  
- **Dependence on Earth**: Despite the evacuation, orbital habitats relied heavily on resources from Earth, creating tension between those who left and those who remained.  

### **Mars Colonies**  
Mars remained the most viable planetary destination:  
- **Limited Intake**: Mars could only accept a fraction of the evacuees due to its fragile infrastructure and limited habitable zones.  
- **Skills-Based Selection**: Only those with expertise in terraforming, engineering, or other critical fields were granted passage.  
- **Social Strain**: The influx of new settlers caused friction with the established Martian population, who feared overburdening their already precarious ecosystem.  

### **Asteroid Belt Stations**  
The Asteroid Belt offered opportunities for those willing to endure its harsh conditions:  
- **Mining Colonies**: Many evacuees were sent to mining outposts to support resource extraction efforts.  
- **Economic Exploitation**: Corporations used the influx of labor to expand their operations, often at the expense of workers’ safety and well-being.

## **Earth’s Decline**  

### **Population Reduction**  
By the end of the Great Evacuation, Earth’s population had fallen to **500 million**, a fraction of its former billions:  
- **Urban Collapse**: Entire cities were abandoned as residents fled or succumbed to famine and disease.  
- **Rural Survival**: Small, scattered communities eked out a living in regions less affected by ecological collapse.  

### **Environmental Degradation**  
The evacuation did little to slow Earth’s environmental decline:  
- **Runaway Climate Change**: Rising temperatures and sea levels continued to render vast regions uninhabitable.  
- **Biodiversity Loss**: The Sixth Mass Extinction accelerated, leaving only isolated species in artificial reserves.  
- **Resource Scarcity**: The few remaining industries struggled to sustain even the reduced population.

## **Social and Political Ramifications**  

### **Resentment and Division**  
The evacuation created deep divides between those who escaped and those left behind:  
- **Class Inequality**: Wealthier individuals and corporate employees were seen as abandoning Earth’s poor to die.  
- **Public Outrage**: Protests and riots broke out in regions excluded from evacuation efforts, targeting government and corporate facilities.  
- **Isolation of Evacuees**: Those who left Earth faced hostility from those who remained, even as they endured their own struggles in off-world habitats.  

### **Collapse of Governance**  
With much of Earth’s leadership evacuating alongside its wealthiest citizens, the planet’s remaining population was left without effective governance:  
- **Local Autonomy**: Regional leaders and enclaves assumed control, often prioritizing their own survival over broader cooperation.  
- **Rise of Corporate Power**: Mega-corporations filled the power vacuum, controlling key resources and dictating evacuation policies.

## **Legacy of the Great Evacuation**  

### **A Temporary Solution**  
The Great Evacuation succeeded in relocating millions but failed to address the underlying crises:  
- **Overcrowding in Space**: Orbital habitats and Mars struggled to accommodate the influx of evacuees, leading to resource shortages and unrest.  
- **Neglect of Earth**: The evacuation diverted resources from Earth’s restoration efforts, accelerating its decline.  

### **A Symbol of Desperation**  
While the evacuation demonstrated humanity’s ingenuity, it also revealed its failure to protect its homeworld:  
- **Loss of Faith**: Many viewed the evacuation as an admission of defeat, a sign that humanity had given up on Earth.  
- **Cultural Impact**: The mass departure created a diaspora, with evacuees struggling to retain their identities and connections to the planet they left behind.

## **Conclusion**  

The Great Evacuation was a turning point in humanity’s history, marking the moment when Earth’s decline became undeniable. While millions escaped to the stars, billions were left to face the planet’s collapse. This event not only reshaped human civilization but also highlighted the cost of neglecting the planet that had once been humanity’s cradle.
