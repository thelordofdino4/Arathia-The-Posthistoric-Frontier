Earth: A World Left Behind
250 Years Before Project Exodus

The Great Evacuation saw humanity’s population on Earth plummet to 500 million. The planet, while no longer worsening in its environmental state, remained largely uninhabitable outside of isolated enclaves. Small, self-sustaining communities persisted, but the lack of effective governance and resource distribution deepened divides between those who stayed and those who left.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 500 million, concentrated in scattered, resource-efficient enclaves.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable but heavily polluted; desalination technology remains critical.

Chemical Environment: Toxic in urban regions; rural zones show limited recovery.

Energy Sources: Predominantly nuclear and solar; small-scale renewable setups power rural enclaves.

Physical Conditions: Stable but challenging, with large swathes of the planet uninhabitable.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 18%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.12% (plateaued but elevated).
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Erratic but no longer worsening; isolated zones experience moderate climates.

Radiation Protection: Fragmented ozone layer provides partial protection; localized efforts mitigate exposure.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining and resource extraction have ceased in many regions.

Ecosystem Support: Around 15% of species persist, concentrated in artificial biomes and rural refuges.

Economic Indicators: Localized, barter-driven economies dominate; global trade networks nonexistent.

Military Capabilities: Fragmented; corporate security forces dominate remaining regions.

Geographical Factors: Temperate regions are primary hubs of survival; equatorial zones largely abandoned.

Demographics: Aging population; youth emigration to space accelerates decline.

Technological Development: Focused on survival technology and maintaining biodiversity archives.

International Relations: Nonexistent; regional governance and corporate enclaves dominate.

Environmental Considerations: Biodiversity maintained in isolated reserves; no large-scale restoration efforts.

Magnetic Field: Stable but insufficient to mitigate radiation without artificial aid.

Geological Activity: Minimal; tectonic stability largely unaffected by human decline.

Mars: A Resurgent Colony
250 Years Before Project Exodus

Despite its past struggles, Mars entered a period of cautious growth. New settlers from the Great Evacuation contributed to a modest resurgence, and terraforming efforts expanded the planet’s habitable zones to 12%. However, resource constraints and social integration posed significant challenges.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 6 million, bolstered by evacuees from Earth.

Presence of Liquid Water: Subsurface aquifers and artificial reservoirs support agriculture and industry.

Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated atmosphere remains inhospitable outside domes.

Energy Sources: Solar and nuclear power sustain the colony; experimental fusion projects see progress.

Physical Conditions: Habitable zones expand but remain fragile; dust storms continue to disrupt infrastructure.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; domes and underground facilities maintain livable conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety for surface settlements.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; resource extraction carefully monitored to avoid destabilization.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farms and biomes meet growing population needs.

Economic Indicators: Moderate growth driven by trade with the Belt and orbital habitats.

Military Capabilities: Focused on internal security and protecting critical resources.

Geographical Factors: Expansion focused near equatorial regions for optimal resource access.

Demographics: Young and diverse workforce; integration of evacuees presents cultural challenges.

Technological Development: Progress in terraforming and resource efficiency drives optimism.

International Relations: Strengthening ties with the Belt; cautious independence from Earth-based entities.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainability prioritized over rapid expansion.

Magnetic Field: Lacking; reliance on artificial radiation shielding persists.

Geological Activity: Minimal; surface activity carefully regulated.

The Belt: Humanity’s Nexus
250 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt solidified its position as humanity’s industrial and economic powerhouse. With over 40 million residents, it became the most stable and prosperous region in human civilization. The influx of labor and resources from the Great Evacuation accelerated its growth, but tensions over autonomy and corporate exploitation simmered.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 40 million, with steady growth from Earth evacuees.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable supply through ice mining; supports expanding industrial and residential needs.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated within habitats; conditions optimized for human life.

Energy Sources: Solar, nuclear, and fusion energy sustain rapid development.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity mitigated through advanced habitat design and health protocols.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; habitats maintain consistent living conditions.

Radiation Protection: Comprehensive shielding protects inhabitants and infrastructure.

Geophysical Stability: Highly monitored; mining operations adhere to strict safety protocols.

Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponic systems reduce reliance on external food imports.

Economic Indicators: Thriving; resource exports underpin interstellar development.

Military Capabilities: Sophisticated corporate security and defense systems ensure stability.

Geographical Factors: Strategic hubs on resource-rich asteroids like Ceres and Vesta dominate industrial output.

Demographics: Diverse, with a mix of skilled laborers, scientists, and corporate officials.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge in mining, AI, and interstellar logistics.

International Relations: Increasing autonomy; Belt leadership pushes for greater independence from Earth corporations.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainable practices ensure long-term viability of operations.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding fully integrated into habitat designs.

Geological Activity: Stable; operations carefully monitored to prevent accidents.
