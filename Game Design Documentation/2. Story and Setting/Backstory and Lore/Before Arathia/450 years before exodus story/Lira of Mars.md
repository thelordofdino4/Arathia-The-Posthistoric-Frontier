# 450 Years Before Project Exodus: The Martian Settler’s Perspective

## *"Red Dust Dreams"*

### The Settlement

The Martian sunrise was unlike anything Lira Orin had seen in her short life on Earth. A pale, pink glow spread across the horizon, illuminating the jagged shadows of Olympus Mons and the sprawling dome of **Arsia Base**. The thin Martian atmosphere filtered the sunlight into muted hues, a faint reminder of the fiery golds and blues she once knew. But this was home now.

In 2160, as the Mars colony began to stretch beyond its original outpost in Valles Marineris, the settlers embarked on a daring expansion into the shadow of Arsia Mons. Known as the “red dust dreams” era, this phase marked the establishment of new dome habitats along the rugged slopes of the colossal shield volcano. The unique geography of Arsia Mons offered more than just a striking backdrop—it provided untapped geothermal energy and easier access to subsurface ice, essential for sustaining life on the harsh Martian surface. Here, pioneers faced the raw, unforgiving Martian landscape with a blend of trepidation and hope, their dreams as vast and volatile as the red dust that swirled around them.

Lira tightened the straps of her oxygen pack as she stepped into the airlock. She watched the dust swirl beyond the reinforced glass—red and relentless. The Martian wind howled softly as the external hatch opened, and she stepped out into the barren expanse.

It had been ten years since she and her family left Earth, joining the second wave of colonists in the **Great Expansion**. Mars had promised opportunity, purpose, and survival—a new frontier for a dying humanity. The red planet delivered, but at a cost.

### Life on Mars

Lira trudged toward the hydroponics dome, the frost crunching under her boots. Life on Mars was precise, every action calculated for efficiency. Each settler had a role, whether tending to the fragile crops, repairing the solar panels, or managing the oxygenators. For Lira, it was agriculture—keeping the crops alive under thin air and weak sunlight.

Inside the hydroponics dome, rows of leafy greens floated in nutrient-rich gel, illuminated by soft, synthetic light. The air was warm and humid, a stark contrast to the icy wasteland outside. It smelled of wet earth, a fabricated scent she clung to as a memory of Earth’s forests.

Her younger brother, Kain, waved to her from the far end of the dome, his face streaked with grime. "The lettuce modules need recalibrating!" he called, holding up a datapad.

"Again?" Lira sighed, pulling out her tools. "I swear these systems are aging faster than we are."

Kain grinned. "Well, better lettuce than more algae, right?"

They both laughed. The algae tanks, vital for oxygen production, were notoriously finicky and stank of brine and decay. Compared to that, tending to lettuce felt like a luxury.

### Dreams of Earth

Later that evening, Lira sat by the observation window in the residential dome, staring at the faint blue dot in the sky. Earth. It looked so small, so fragile—a distant memory growing dimmer with each passing year.

She could still remember the *feel* of Earth: the weight of its gravity pulling her down, the warmth of the sun on her face, the endless expanse of green that stretched beyond her old village. Here, the air was synthetic, the ground lifeless, and the sun a pale imitation of its former self.

"Do you think Earth will ever recover?" Kain asked, joining her by the window.

Lira shook her head. "Not in our lifetime. Maybe not ever. That’s why we’re here. We’re the backup plan."

Kain frowned, his boyish face clouded with doubt. "But Mars… it’s not really living, is it? It’s surviving."

Lira didn’t answer. She didn’t need to. The quiet hum of the life-support systems around them spoke louder than words.

### The Struggle

The next morning brought another dust storm, stronger than usual. The settlement’s weather alarms blared, and Lira hurried to the control hub. The storm wasn’t just a nuisance; it was a threat. Martian storms could last weeks, and their static electricity often disrupted critical systems.

"We’ve lost power to the east oxygenator!" someone shouted as Lira arrived. The hub was chaos—settlers scrambling over consoles, alarms flashing red.

Lira’s heart sank. Without the oxygenator, the eastern dome’s air would thin rapidly. It wasn’t just crops at risk—it was lives.

"I’ll go," she volunteered, grabbing her oxygen pack.

"You can’t!" Kain grabbed her arm. "The storm’s too strong—you’ll get stranded!"

"People are counting on us," Lira said firmly, pulling away. "We didn’t come here to fail."

### The Storm

The wind was a relentless force, whipping red dust against Lira’s visor and obscuring her view. The oxygenator was a few hundred meters away, but every step felt like a battle. Her oxygen pack hissed as she breathed, the sound a steady reminder of her vulnerability.

When she reached the oxygenator, it was worse than she expected. The storm had torn a panel free, and fine Martian dust had infiltrated the system, clogging the filters. Lira worked quickly, her hands trembling in the freezing air. Every second outside was a risk.

Finally, the system hummed back to life, and she let out a shaky breath. But as she turned to leave, a gust of wind knocked her to the ground, her oxygen pack skidding away. Panic set in as she scrambled to retrieve it, the thin atmosphere already burning her lungs.

"Kain, I need help!" she gasped into her comm.

### The Bond

When Lira woke, she was back in the residential dome. Kain sat beside her, his face pale with worry. "You’re insane," he muttered. "But you fixed it. Everyone’s okay because of you."

Lira managed a weak smile. "That’s why we’re here, isn’t it? To make this work, no matter what?"

Kain shook his head. "You can’t do everything, Lira. We have to take care of each other, too."

### The Legacy

That night, as the storm raged on outside, Lira stared at Earth again. It was distant and unreachable, but she knew that everything they were building on Mars was for the people they had left behind. It wasn’t easy, and it wasn’t perfect, but it was hope.

"We’ll get it right," she whispered. "Even if it takes generations."

Mars wasn’t home—not yet. But it was the first step toward something greater. And for Lira, that was enough.
