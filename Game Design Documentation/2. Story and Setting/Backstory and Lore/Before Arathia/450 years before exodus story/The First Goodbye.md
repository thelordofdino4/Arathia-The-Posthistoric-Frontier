The First Goodbye

Setting:

450 Years Before Project Exodus, Earth is still a world with lush, albeit dwindling, natural landscapes. The 23rd century is marked by a struggle to preserve what remains of the planet’s diverse biosphere. The Mars Colonial Initiative is humanity’s bold step toward survival beyond Earth, but Earth itself is still green, filled with forests and wildlife attempting to thrive amidst humanity’s ongoing environmental damage.

Story:

Dr. Evelyn Hart stood on the balcony of the Terran Institute of Preservation, overlooking the sprawling wilderness reserve that stretched out before her. The reserve, one of Earth’s largest remaining sanctuaries for wildlife, was a testament to humanity’s commitment to preserving life, even as the planet inched toward collapse. Tall oaks and maple trees swayed in the gentle breeze, their leaves still vibrant with the greens and yellows of spring. A herd of deer grazed peacefully near a crystalline lake, and the calls of birds echoed in the air.

The sight filled Evelyn with both pride and sorrow. She had spent decades fighting to protect these sanctuaries, but the undeniable truth loomed large: Earth was dying, and no amount of preservation could stop the inevitable.

The shuttle’s engines roared in the distance, a low hum that steadily grew louder. It was the last vessel scheduled to leave for Mars that year, carrying a new wave of colonists to the red planet. Unlike earlier launches, this one was special—it marked the conclusion of the first phase of the Mars Colonial Initiative.

Evelyn adjusted the small recording device in her hand, the lens catching the glint of the sun. This message was not just for the colonists boarding the shuttle; it was for all those who would follow, for the generations yet to come. With a deep breath, she began to speak.

Dr. Evelyn Hart’s Message:

“To the brave souls venturing to Mars,

Today, you leave behind the cradle of humanity, the only home our species has ever known. Earth has nurtured us for millennia, its soil feeding us, its forests sheltering us, and its oceans sustaining us. As you step into the unknown, I ask you to remember this: Earth is not merely a planet. It is a part of who we are.

I stand here at the edge of a sanctuary—a place where life still roams free. The deer grazing in the fields, the birds soaring above, and the trees swaying in the wind are reminders of what we fight for, of what we’ve lost, and of what we must protect.

Mars is a blank slate, a place where humanity can start anew. But do not let it erase the memory of the world that made us. Carry with you the lessons of this Earth: the resilience of its creatures, the beauty of its landscapes, and the fragility of its balance. Let them guide you as you build a future beyond these skies.

The work you do will define humanity’s path. You are not merely colonists; you are the stewards of a legacy that stretches back to the dawn of time. You carry the hope of a species and the weight of an entire biosphere. Let that responsibility inspire you, not burden you.

Remember your roots. Remember your home.”

Evelyn paused, her voice catching in her throat. She looked out at the wilderness one last time before continuing.

“This may be the last goodbye for many of us who remain on Earth. But it is not the end. In every step you take on Martian soil, in every structure you build, and in every life you save, Earth will be with you. And perhaps, one day, when the stars align and humanity has healed, you or your descendants will return to this blue and green world. Until then, carry its spirit with you.

Safe travels, and may the stars guide you.”

Aftermath:

The shuttle’s engines roared to life, ascending into the atmosphere and leaving a trail of fire and smoke in its wake. Evelyn stood silently, clutching the recording device to her chest. Her message, along with countless others, would be stored in the archives of the Mars Colonial Initiative, meant to remind humanity of its origins.

Years later, colonists on Mars would gather in a communal dome, watching Dr. Hart’s message projected onto a screen. Her words became a rallying cry for unity and purpose, inspiring the first generation of Martian-born humans to carry Earth’s memory with them as they forged a new chapter in humanity’s history.
