450 Years Before Project Exodus

At this time, Earth retains a diverse biosphere but is visibly on the path of decline. 50% of all species have gone extinct, and the effects of climate change, deforestation, and pollution are increasingly evident. While natural ecosystems remain intact in many areas, they are shrinking at an alarming rate. Urban centers are operational, and technological advancements persist, but cracks in infrastructure and governance are beginning to show.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 10 billion.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable but under stress due to pollution and overuse in many regions.

Chemical Environment: Increasingly acidic oceans; rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

Energy Sources: Heavy reliance on fossil fuels, with growing investments in nuclear and renewable energy.

Physical Conditions: Rising temperatures and sea levels, frequent extreme weather events.

Atmospheric Composition: Elevated greenhouse gases, regional air quality issues.

Climate Stability: Declining; frequent droughts, hurricanes, and unpredictable weather.

Radiation Protection: Intact ozone layer but showing signs of depletion.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, but deforestation and resource extraction exacerbate local risks.

Ecosystem Support: Shrinking biodiversity; stressed but functional ecosystems.

Economic Indicators: GDP growth slowing; widening inequality between nations.

Military Capabilities: Still robust, with significant global arsenals.

Geographical Factors: Large-scale urbanization; some rural areas abandoned due to resource depletion.

Demographics: Growth slowing; urban migration increasing.

Technological Development: Early interplanetary travel and genetic engineering; advanced computing.

International Relations: Rising tensions over resource access; early signs of mega-corporate influence.

Environmental Considerations: Resource scarcity and pollution dominate global policy discussions.

Magnetic Field: Stable and protective.

Geological Activity: Normal tectonic activity, with some increased risks due to mining and deforestation.

Mars: The First Colony

450 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars has just begun its journey as humanityâ€™s first off-world colony. The initial settlement, located in Valles Marineris, relies entirely on artificial habitats and imported supplies. Early terraforming efforts focus on extracting subsurface ice and introducing basic atmospheric processing.

Key Points:

Population: A few thousand.

Presence of Liquid Water: Subsurface ice only; no liquid water on the surface.

Chemical Environment: Thin CO2-dominated atmosphere, unsuitable for human life.

Energy Sources: Solar arrays and nuclear reactors power the colony.

Physical Conditions: Harsh; cold temperatures and low atmospheric pressure.

Atmospheric Composition: Predominantly CO2; minimal oxygen.

Climate Stability: Extremely stable but uninhabitable without artificial environments.

Radiation Protection: Limited; habitats use shielding to counteract solar and cosmic radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Stable but prone to dust storms.

Ecosystem Support: None; experiments with hydroponics and controlled biomes underway.

Economic Indicators: Entirely reliant on Earth for resources and funding.

Military Capabilities: None; colony security managed by Earth-based entities.

Geographical Factors: Strategic location near ice deposits.

Demographics: Highly specialized workforce of scientists and engineers.

Technological Development: Advanced life support and hydroponic systems; nascent terraforming technology.

International Relations: Governed by an Earth-based coalition of nations and corporations.

Environmental Considerations: Focused on minimizing habitat degradation and establishing sustainable systems.

Magnetic Field: Lacks a magnetic field, increasing radiation exposure.

Geological Activity: Inactive; stable surface.
