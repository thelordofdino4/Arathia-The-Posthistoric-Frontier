### **Moonfall: The Forgotten Colony**

The lunar dust settled in slow, graceful arcs, disturbed only by the faint tremors of failing infrastructure beneath the surface. From within the observation deck of **Luna Prime**, Administrator Jonah Tellis stared out at the cold expanse of Mare Tranquillitatis. Beyond the reinforced glass, the domed habitats of the Selene Project—once the pride of human ingenuity—stood in eerie silence. Cracks lined their reinforced surfaces, remnants of the constant battle against micrometeorite strikes and unrelenting radiation.

The year was **2148**, and the Moon was being abandoned.

For decades, Luna Prime had been a jewel of off-world ambition. The Selene Project was meant to prove that humanity could sustain itself beyond Earth, that they could turn the barren regolith into a home. And for a time, they had. Lunar ice was extracted, turned to water and breathable air. Solar fields stretched across the surface, absorbing every last scrap of energy they could harness. Modular greenhouses grew genetically modified crops under artificial sunlight. The Moon was never a paradise, but it had been **livable**.

Until it wasn’t.

Tellis turned from the viewport, the weight of command pressing down on his already aching frame. **The call had come through hours ago.** Final confirmation. Dominion Industries and Orbital Dynamics Corporation, known at the time as "the United Western Aerospace Authority" had declared the Moon no longer viable. The decision had been inevitable. Over the last decade, priorities had shifted; **Mars**—with its vast underground reservoirs of ice, its potential geothermal energy—had taken precedence. The Selene Project had been rendered **obsolete**. The last shipments of critical supplies from Earth had already been redirected to the Martian frontier, and the final evacuation order had been issued.

The Moon was being **evacuated**.

Tellis entered the control room where his senior staff waited. **Dr. Reema Basu**, the lead scientist, had dark circles under her eyes, her fingers nervously tapping against a tablet displaying the latest atmospheric processor failures. **Commander Erik Saul**, head of security, leaned against the wall, his gaze empty. They had fought for every remaining resource, every last shipment of supplies, but it had not been enough.

“We have thirty-six hours before the final shuttle departs,” Tellis said, his voice heavy. “You all know what that means.”

Basu exhaled sharply, setting down her tablet. “We’re really doing this, then? Just…leaving it all behind?”

Saul shook his head. “Not ‘we.’ Everyone. No one is staying behind.”

Tellis met his gaze. They had discussed this already, in hushed tones when the reality of their situation became clear. The shuttles had limited capacity, but every last effort had been made to ensure **all** remaining personnel would be relocated to Mars. The process had not been easy—selecting who would leave first, organizing the dismantling of key infrastructure, and deciding which assets could be salvaged before departure.

“There’s no other option,” Tellis said, forcing himself to keep his voice steady. “The Mars Initiative needs resources more than we do. They’re still expanding, still building. They have a future.”

Basu let out a bitter laugh. “And what do we have? A graveyard?”

Tellis hesitated. There was no good answer to that. The Selene Project had been **humanity’s first real step into the stars**, and now it would be **their first great abandonment**.

Some would look back on the Moon as the first step towards something greater. Others would see it as a failure—a colony that, while once thriving, had been overshadowed by grander aspirations. But everyone would leave. **No one would be left behind.**

Basu’s voice trembled. “They won’t even talk about us in the future, will they?”

Tellis felt a hollow pit in his stomach. She was right. The Moon’s fate would be buried beneath the towering achievements of Mars and, eventually, beyond. There would be no monuments to Luna Prime, no records of the men and women who fought to make it habitable. The Selene Project would become a **footnote**, a forgotten endeavor overshadowed by greater conquests.

The final hours passed in a haze. The air recyclers, strained beyond their limits, continued their slow decline. The power grid flickered, each outage lasting just a little longer than the last. When the last transport shuttle lifted off, carrying the final group of lunar colonists towards Mars, Tellis stood on the command deck, watching as the lights of Earth glowed in the distant void.

There would be no return.

The Moon, humanity’s first outpost beyond Earth, was left to the dust and silence—a relic of a path abandoned, a chapter closed, a dream **forgotten**.
