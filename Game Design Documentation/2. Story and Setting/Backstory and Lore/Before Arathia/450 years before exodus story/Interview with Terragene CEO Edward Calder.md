Interview with Terragene CEO Edward Calder

Location: Terragene Industries Headquarters, EarthTime: 450 Years Before Project Exodus

Reporter: "Thank you for sitting down with me today, Mr. Calder. With the first domes on Mars nearing completion, many see Terragene as the cornerstone of this historic endeavor. Can you share your thoughts on how far we've come?"

Edward Calder: (smiling faintly) "It’s been a long road. When I first joined Terragene nearly five decades ago, Mars colonization was just a far-off dream—a concept confined to speculative papers and science fiction. To see it now… to know we’ve built something tangible on another world… it’s humbling. But we didn’t do this alone. This is humanity’s effort. We’re just a piece of a much larger puzzle."

Reporter: "And yet, your company’s contributions have been monumental. From atmospheric processors to advanced construction materials, Terragene has provided the tools that made the Martian domes possible. What has driven this level of commitment?"

Edward Calder: "Survival. As much as I’d like to dress it up in lofty ideals, the truth is simple: Earth is faltering. The climate crises, dwindling resources, mass extinction events… these aren’t abstract threats. They’re happening now. Mars represents our first real chance to build a safety net. At Terragene, we believe in creating solutions, not waiting for miracles."

Reporter: "Some critics argue that efforts like Mars colonization divert attention and resources from solving Earth’s problems. How do you respond to that?"

Edward Calder: (leaning forward) "It’s not an either-or scenario. We’re investing heavily in Earth’s restoration efforts—reforestation projects, wildlife preservation, renewable energy initiatives. But the reality is, we’ve passed a tipping point. Even if we stabilize Earth, it will take centuries to recover. We can’t afford to put all our hopes in one basket. Mars is our backup plan, our second chance."

Reporter: "You’ve been at the helm of Terragene during some of its most transformative years. Yet, you’ve hinted at stepping down in recent board meetings. What does the future of Terragene look like without Edward Calder?"

Edward Calder: (pausing, visibly contemplative) "No one leads forever. I’m proud of what we’ve built, but the next chapter belongs to a new generation. I’ve spent the past few years ensuring that Terragene’s leadership team shares our vision—not just for Mars, but for humanity’s future. The company’s strength lies in its people. As long as they remain committed, Terragene will continue to innovate."

Reporter: "There’s been speculation about who might succeed you. Any comment on that?"

Edward Calder: (chuckling) "I’ll leave that to the board to decide. But I will say this: whoever steps into this role will inherit immense responsibility. They’ll need to balance ambition with caution, innovation with sustainability. It’s not an easy task, but it’s a necessary one."

Reporter: "Speaking of responsibility, what message would you like to send to the pioneers on Mars who will soon inhabit these domes?"

Edward Calder: "To the brave men and women heading to Mars: you carry the weight of humanity’s hopes and dreams. What you’re doing is unprecedented, and it won’t be easy. But remember, you’re not just surviving—you’re building a future. For every challenge you face, there’s an entire world here rooting for your success. Stay resilient, stay hopeful, and know that your work matters more than you can imagine."

Reporter: "That’s a powerful sentiment, Mr. Calder. Before we wrap up, one final question: When you look at Mars and everything humanity is striving for, what do you feel?"

Edward Calder: (smiling softly) "Hope. Fragile, tentative hope. Mars is a testament to what we can achieve when we work together. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest times, we have the ability to dream big and turn those dreams into reality. And it’s a call to action—to keep striving, to keep building, to never give up on the possibility of a better tomorrow."

Reporter: "Thank you, Mr. Calder. It’s been an honor to hear your insights."

Edward Calder: "The honor is mine. Let’s hope the next generation does even better than we did."

(As the interview concludes, the camera pans to a holographic display of Mars, its red surface illuminated by the flicker of domed cities under construction. Calder’s reflection lingers in the glass, a figure of determination and doubt as humanity’s interplanetary journey begins.)
