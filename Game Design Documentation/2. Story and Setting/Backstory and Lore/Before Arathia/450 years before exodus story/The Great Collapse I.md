The Great Collapse, Part I (Circa 450 YBE)

Administrator Nareen Delgado stepped up to the podium in Geneva’s packed conference hall, her voice amplified by crackling speakers that echoed through the tense assembly. Delegates from the largest nations, corporate magnates, and a smattering of environmental activists had gathered to decide humanity’s fate—or so it seemed to everyone watching from across the globe.

“Thank you all for coming,” Delgado said, attempting a calm tone she did not feel. “We’ve all seen the data.” She gestured to the flickering holo-screen behind her, which displayed maps of barren farmland, receding polar ice, and staggering extinction rates. “We hoped these warnings were exaggerated, but they are now a stark reality we can’t escape.”

At the back of the room, a young climatologist named Dr. Ariel Song rubbed her temples. Only a few months ago, her groundbreaking report projected that average global temperatures would surpass the critical threshold within a decade unless greenhouse gas emissions were slashed drastically. She never imagined it would be taken so seriously, so quickly—or that it would form the backbone of an emergency summit with this level of urgency.

A hush fell when Delgado’s next words amplified across the chamber: “We’re looking at relentless heatwaves reducing once-productive farmland to lifeless desert. We’ve documented glacier retreat unlike anything recorded in human history. Over the past two years alone, we have lost entire species—gone forever.” She bowed her head briefly, as though struggling to compose herself. “Our reefs are dying, exposing coastal regions to unmitigated storm surges. We’re fast approaching a point of no return.”

A heavy silence took hold before the murmuring began—anxious conversations in half a dozen languages. Monitors showed footage from storm-wracked coastlines and dried-up riverbeds, images that stoked the delegates’ unease. Nareen Delgado pressed her palms to the podium.

“Let me be very clear,” she continued. “Nations are starting to clash over fresh water, farmland, and energy. Refugee crises have already escalated as climate upheaval drives entire communities from their homes. Our security analysts warn that if we don’t reach a workable agreement on resource allocation, we may see all-out conflict in less than ten years. Meanwhile, corporate entities are trying to fill the gap left by struggling governments—providing water purification and hydroponic systems at a profit. Public trust in national leadership is at an all-time low.”

In the front row, an executive from Helios Corporation cleared his throat, shifting uncomfortably under the gaze of delegates who viewed these corporate rescue efforts with suspicion. Across the aisle, the foreign minister from a coastal nation battered by hurricanes clutched a folder of urgent appeals, desperation written on his face.

Dr. Song tapped at her tablet, pulling up the latest satellite feed. It showed a swirl of oceanic storms near the equator, each supercharged by warming waters. She took a steadying breath before stepping toward the dais.

“If I may,” she said softly. The murmuring settled. “I’ve just received updated readings. They confirm that if we continue on this trajectory, we will see even faster sea-level rise by next spring. The expansions of refugee zones will strain every resource distribution system we have. We might contain the fallout if we act immediately and in unison, but the next few years are critical.”

A wave of uneasy energy rippled through the room. Whispers of the phrase “The Great Collapse” passed between the delegates, echoing a scenario feared by many: a chain reaction of famine, water wars, and political unraveling that would push the world to the brink.

An older statesman from the United States stood, clutching the edges of his seat to steady himself. “I spent my childhood in a midwestern farming town,” he said with a tremor in his voice. “My entire region is a dust bowl now. We can’t just talk about this—people are starving. We need a global plan for immediate relief and a longer-term strategy for fundamental change.”

Delgado nodded solemnly. “We do. There are proposals—an emission cap treaty, a planetary-scale reforestation effort, international resource-sharing agreements… but we lack consensus and time. Meanwhile, there are those who say Earth might be beyond saving, that off-world prospects like Luna or the Mars Colonial Initiative are our only way out.”

In the back of the hall, discontent rumbled. Some delegates balked at funneling resources into space rather than solving Earth’s imminent catastrophes. Others privately saw an exodus as the ultimate backup plan. Dr. Song closed her eyes, recalling the lab’s motto: Solve Earth’s crisis first. Leaving Earth behind, even partially, felt unthinkable.

Stepping away from the mic, Delgado allowed a moment for the weight of reality to settle over the gathering. The onlookers—politicians, CEOs, scientists—were joined in a single certainty: the years ahead would be decisive. Half measures now risked plunging humanity into catastrophic decline, with unstoppable climate feedback loops and widespread civil unrest.

Outside, a sudden clap of thunder rattled the windows, as if to underscore the meeting’s urgency. The Great Collapse was no longer a doomsday rumor whispered by fringe thinkers. It loomed over them in stark data, battered coastlines, and scorched farmland.

The question hovered in the charged air: would they find the resolve to act decisively, or would this gathering become just another footnote in humanity’s slow march to oblivion?
