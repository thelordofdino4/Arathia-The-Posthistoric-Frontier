Corporate Resistance: FTL Travel and the Panic of Control
350 Years Before Project Exodus

The success of the Daedalus was meant to be a moment of celebration. Humanity had cracked the code to faster-than-light (FTL) travel, finally unlocking the means to traverse the vast expanse of space. For the dreamers, it was a promise of new frontiers. For Earth’s mega-corporations, it was an existential threat.

In the boardrooms of power, there was no cheering. Only silence.

Victor Margrave, CEO of Helios Industries, leaned against the wide glass window of his top-floor office, the smog-filled horizon of Earth stretching beneath him. Around him, holographic projections of his peers—leaders of Mars’s mining conglomerates and Belt industrial tycoons—hovered like specters. The air was thick with tension as Margrave turned to face his audience.

“You all know why we’re here,” he began, his voice sharp and deliberate. “The Daedalus didn’t just succeed in its mission—it succeeded in tearing open Pandora’s box. Colonies will see this as their ticket to independence. Entire worlds will slip from our grasp. If we lose control over them now, we’ll never get it back.”

A murmur rippled through the group. One of the holograms, a burly man representing Mars’s largest terraforming operation, spoke up.

“Victor, this is a panic for later. FTL is still experimental, decades away from manned missions. Why act now?”

Margrave’s expression darkened. “Because every step forward makes it harder to stop. If humanity scatters to the stars, how do we maintain supply chains, enforce trade, or even project influence? This is bigger than one ship’s success. It’s the start of a rebellion.”

The discussion quickly turned brutal. Ideas were tossed out like missiles: infiltrate scientific teams, disrupt critical supply lines, discredit the safety of FTL travel. Margrave jotted each down with cold precision.

“This isn’t about ending progress,” he clarified. “It’s about owning it. Humanity can leave the cradle, but they’ll do so under our terms. If we can’t control the stars, we control the ships that get there.”

A chorus of approval echoed through the room, but not everyone was swayed.

Sitting toward the edge of the conference table, Elias Cormack—now CEO of Terragene, after inheriting the role under controversial circumstances—watched silently. Unlike many in the room, his demeanor was measured, his sharp eyes absorbing every word but revealing little of his thoughts.

“Cormack,” Margrave called, narrowing his eyes. “You haven’t said much. What’s your stance on this?”

Cormack offered a polite smile but remained seated, keeping his tone neutral. “It’s a lot to process. The implications of FTL travel are enormous, no doubt about it.” He paused, choosing his words carefully. “But I believe any drastic measures should be approached cautiously. After all, humanity’s survival depends on cooperation, not division.”

“Cooperation?” Margrave’s sneer was palpable. “We’re talking about maintaining control over our future. Cooperation doesn’t build empires, Elias. Control does.”

Cormack inclined his head, not rising to the bait. “Perhaps. But control is a fleeting thing. If we alienate the colonies before they’ve even had a chance to spread their wings, we risk losing everything in the long term.”

The room murmured at his measured defiance, but Cormack’s delivery was deliberate. He knew better than to outright challenge the dominant voices in the room. Instead, he offered subtle resistance, planting seeds of doubt without openly positioning himself against Margrave.

As the discussion moved on, Cormack’s mind was already elsewhere. He thought of Nora Vale, whose resolute vision had shaped so much of his own ethos. She had often warned of the dangers of stagnation and complacency, urging those around her to look beyond immediate control to the broader survival of humanity. Her words echoed now, a steadying mantra in the face of Margrave’s schemes.

Cormack had made up his mind long before this meeting—he would act to protect FTL development, even if it meant working in the shadows. For now, however, he knew better than to tip his hand.

The Fallout

In the weeks following the meeting, Cormack made a quiet departure from Terragene. To his colleagues, it was a surprise; to those in the know, it was a statement. Rumors swirled that he had begun collaborating with independent scientists to shield FTL technology from corporate sabotage. While most dismissed his efforts as futile, they gained traction among researchers and activists who saw interstellar travel as humanity’s only hope.

Meanwhile, Margrave’s coalition launched a covert campaign to slow FTL development. Accidents plagued key facilities, supply chains mysteriously faltered, and media outlets spun cautionary tales of catastrophic voyages. Despite this, the tide of progress could not be stemmed entirely. The visionaries and idealists fought back, driven by an unyielding belief that humanity’s survival depended on reaching the stars.

Epilogue

For the corporations, the rise of FTL travel marked the beginning of their greatest challenge. For humanity, it was a beacon of hope. And for Elias Cormack, it was a call to action. Years later, historians would credit his quiet defiance as one of the pivotal moments in securing humanity’s journey into the cosmos.

But for now, in shadowed rooms and aboard quiet stations, the battle for the stars had only just begun.
