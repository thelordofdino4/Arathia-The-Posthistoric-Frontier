Earth: A Planet in Decline
375 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth continues its descent into ecological and societal collapse. The population decreases further, with just under 2 billion people remaining, mostly concentrated in surviving urban enclaves and corporate-controlled territories. Environmental conditions worsen, with climate instability and resource scarcity driving widespread famine and conflict.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 1.9 billion, fragmented across urban centers and isolated rural enclaves.

Presence of Liquid Water: Critically endangered; remaining freshwater sources are heavily polluted or monopolized by corporate interests.

Chemical Environment: Oceans highly acidic; atmospheric CO2 levels dangerously elevated.

Energy Sources: Renewable energy expansion stalls; reliance on remaining fossil fuels and nuclear power continues.

Physical Conditions: Extreme heat, megastorms, and rising seas devastate habitability.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 19.6%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.08% (escalating levels accelerate climate instability)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Virtually nonexistent; frequent natural disasters exacerbate living conditions.

Radiation Protection: The ozone layer shows severe depletion in key regions.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, though mining and deforestation worsen localized risks.

Ecosystem Support: Approximately 35% of species remain; ecosystems are fragmented and near collapse.

Economic Indicators: Extreme wealth concentration; economies dominated by survival-driven mega-corporations.

Military Capabilities: Corporations control private security forces; national militaries diminish in influence.

Geographical Factors: Coastal regions continue to submerge; arid zones expand.

Demographics: Aging population; urban migration and displacement accelerate.

Technological Development: Limited to corporate priorities; advanced AI and resource extraction technologies thrive.

International Relations: Nonexistent; corporate interests replace traditional geopolitics.

Environmental Considerations: Minimal; corporate survival strategies dominate policy.

Magnetic Field: Stable but irrelevant to worsening surface conditions.

Geological Activity: Normal but exacerbated locally by unsustainable human activity.

Mars: A Planet Under Strain
375 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars remains at its peak population of 4 million, with no capacity for further growth under existing technologies. Resource scarcity and infrastructure strain create widespread discontent. The failure of Jovian colonization efforts increases Mars’ reliance on the Belt, solidifying its precarious position.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 4 million, stagnant due to resource constraints.

Presence of Liquid Water: Subsurface ice remains the primary source; aquifers operate at full capacity.

Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated atmosphere persists; domed zones maintain Earth-like conditions.

Energy Sources: Solar and nuclear reactors operate near maximum efficiency.

Physical Conditions: Cramped habitats face frequent maintenance challenges.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; terraforming efforts slow and insufficient.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground facilities provide necessary shielding.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; dust storms remain a logistical challenge.

Ecosystem Support: Limited to hydroponic farming; controlled biomes face scaling limitations.

Economic Indicators: Dependency on Belt resources increases economic pressure.

Military Capabilities: Focused on resource protection and internal stability.

Geographical Factors: Fully exploited habitable zones; new settlements stalled by technological limits.

Demographics: Skilled workforce ages; social tensions rise with resource rationing.

Technological Development: Advanced in life-support systems; minimal progress in terraforming.

International Relations: Tensions with Earth and Belt over resource allocation intensify.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainability remains critical but elusive.

Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; habitats rely entirely on artificial shielding.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring stable construction zones.

The Belt: Humanity’s Economic Engine
375 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt expands its population and influence, becoming the primary supplier of water, metals, and other resources critical to Earth and Mars. Innovations in mining and habitat construction improve conditions, but tensions between Belters, Earth corporations, and Martian interests grow.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 1.5 million, driven by steady migration and economic opportunities.

Presence of Liquid Water: Ice mining supports growing habitats and resource needs.

Chemical Environment: Regulated within habitats; Earth-like conditions prevail.

Energy Sources: Solar power and experimental fusion reactors meet expanding demand.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity and radiation exposure remain key challenges.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially maintained; habitats provide stable living environments.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining operations carefully monitored to prevent disasters.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farms expand but remain reliant on imports.

Economic Indicators: Rapid growth continues; wealth concentrated among corporate entities.

Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces grow more robust to protect operations.

Geographical Factors: Operations expand to more asteroids, including Hygiea and Pallas.

Demographics: Young workforce; permanent settlers increase gradually.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge in resource extraction and orbital construction.

International Relations: Strained relations with Earth and Mars; independence movements gain traction.

Environmental Considerations: Operations prioritize efficiency to minimize failures.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety.

Geological Activity: Closely monitored to avoid operational risks.

Jupiter’s Moons: A Struggling Frontier
375 Years Before Project Exodus

Colonization efforts on Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto falter under harsh conditions. Research stations continue limited operations, but widespread settlement proves unsustainable. The failures force humanity to redirect its focus inward, leaving the Jovian system sparsely populated.

Key Points:

Population: Fewer than 10,000 across all three moons, primarily researchers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Limited success in extracting subsurface water on Europa.

Chemical Environment: Extreme cold and radiation dominate; habitats maintain controlled conditions.

Energy Sources: Small-scale nuclear reactors sustain operations.

Physical Conditions: Harsh environments make large-scale settlement untenable.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificial; habitats remain viable but fragile.

Radiation Protection: Shielding technology mitigates but doesn’t eliminate risks.

Geophysical Stability: Europa’s ice crust poses unique challenges for infrastructure.

Ecosystem Support: None; reliance on imports from Mars and the Belt.

Economic Indicators: Limited viability; operations viewed as experimental.

Military Capabilities: Minimal; research stations lack significant defenses.

Geographical Factors: Sparse settlements focus on resource exploration.

Demographics: Highly specialized workforce; temporary assignments dominate.

Technological Development: Advanced in radiation shielding and modular habitat design.

International Relations: Increasingly irrelevant; focus shifts to inner solar system.

Environmental Considerations: Low-impact operations minimize environmental disruption.

Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; habitats depend on advanced shielding.
