The Weight of Command

Time: 94 Years Before Project ExodusLocation: One-World Government Headquarters, Central Allocation Bureau

The room was silent save for the rhythmic hum of the air circulation system. High Commissioner Adrien Lorre sat alone at their desk, a holographic display casting a cold glow over their features. The screen was filled with dossiers—millions of them—each representing a human life vying for a place aboard the Exodus fleet. Adrien rubbed their temples, the weight of the task pressing down like a physical burden.

Every dossier was a story. A young mother with a degree in biochemistry. A weathered miner with three decades of experience in the Asteroid Belt. A brilliant artist whose work had lifted spirits in even the darkest days. There were millions more, each pleading silently for salvation.

“We’re running out of time,” Adrien muttered to no one. The Exodus fleet’s construction was progressing, but it would not be ready to accommodate everyone. Only a fraction of humanity would make it aboard. The rest would be left behind on a dying Earth.

The Selection Process

The selection process was both meticulous and brutal. Candidates were evaluated based on their skills, health, genetic diversity, and potential contributions to the new colonies. A tiered system prioritized essential personnel: scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and those with specialized knowledge critical for survival in space.

Adrien scrolled through the top-tier list. Names and faces flashed by, accompanied by detailed assessments of their qualifications. The algorithm had done most of the work, but final approval lay with Adrien and their team. Every decision was scrutinized, every omission questioned.

The weight of those omissions gnawed at Adrien. They’d approved the selection of an agricultural specialist over a teacher just hours ago. Both were vital, but there was no room for both.

“How do we decide whose future is worth more?” Adrien whispered.

Public Resentment

Outside the OWG headquarters, protests raged. Thousands gathered daily, shouting slogans, waving signs, demanding answers. The global lottery system, intended to give the general population a sliver of hope, had done little to quell the unrest. Accusations of corruption and favoritism were rampant.

Adrien’s face had become a symbol of the Exodus project. To some, they were a savior, guiding humanity to the stars. To others, they were a tyrant, deciding who lived and who perished.

The protests had turned violent in recent weeks. Security at the headquarters had been increased, and Adrien’s movements were heavily monitored. Even so, they felt the danger lurking behind every shadow.

The Assassination Attempt

It happened during a rare public address. Adrien stood at the podium, addressing the world via live broadcast. They spoke of unity, sacrifice, and hope, their words carefully chosen to inspire but not mislead.

“Project Exodus is not a solution for everyone,” Adrien said. “But it is humanity’s best chance. We must move forward together, even as we face impossible choices—”

The crack of a gunshot silenced the crowd. Chaos erupted as security forces swarmed the stage. Adrien was pulled to safety, their heart pounding as they registered what had happened. The bullet had missed by inches, shattering the glass podium instead.

Hours later, in the safety of a secure bunker, Adrien reviewed footage of the incident. The would-be assassin was a gaunt man in his late forties, his eyes hollow with desperation. His family had been denied a place on the fleet.

“Do you know what he shouted before he fired?” one of the security officers asked.

Adrien shook their head.

“He said, ‘Why is your life worth more than mine?’”

A Moment of Reflection

That night, Adrien stood on the balcony of their quarters, looking out over the city. The fires of protest had been extinguished for now, but the anger lingered. The question haunted them: Why was their life worth more?

They had no answer. Their position gave them power, but it also placed them in an impossible role. No one was truly worthy of deciding humanity’s future, yet someone had to.

Adrien’s thoughts turned to the families left behind, the artists and dreamers who wouldn’t board the fleet. They thought of the children who played among the ruins, unaware of the dark future awaiting them. They thought of the weight they bore and how it would never be enough to justify the decisions they had made.

A New Plan

In the days following the assassination attempt, Adrien met with the OWG’s Council of Command. The attack had underscored the depths of public despair and the inadequacy of their current plans.

“We need to expand the fleet,” Adrien said, their voice firm. “One ship isn’t enough. If we’re truly committed to saving humanity, we need to build more. A thousand ships, each capable of carrying millions.”

The room erupted in murmurs of disbelief. The logistical challenges alone would push the project back decades. Resources would be stretched even thinner. Yet Adrien’s resolve did not waver.

“It’s not about logistics,” they continued. “It’s about hope. The people need to know we’re not abandoning them. They need to believe there’s a future for more than just a chosen few.”

Reluctantly, the council agreed. The plan was revised, the scale of Project Exodus expanded exponentially. The decision would delay humanity’s departure, but it offered a renewed sense of purpose. With this shift, Adrien’s role changed—no longer approving individuals but overseeing the broader logistics of ensuring humanity’s survival on a greater scale.

The Next Morning

When the sun rose, Adrien returned to their desk. The dossiers remained, not for approval but as a symbol of the lives at stake. With the expanded fleet, there was more room for hope. More lives saved, more stories carried into the stars.

Adrien took a deep breath and began drafting a new framework for the allocation process, ensuring fairness and efficiency for the larger project.

They didn’t know if the expanded plan would be enough. But they knew they had to try. For humanity, for the future, for the faint hope that someone, somewhere, might look back and understand the impossible burden they had carried.
