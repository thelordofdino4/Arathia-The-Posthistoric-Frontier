Public Address to the People of the One-World Government
Time: 95 Years Before Project ExodusLocation: Central Hall of the One-World Government Headquarters

Speaker: Chancellor Liora Albright, Representative of the OWG Council

The broadcast begins with a panoramic view of Earth—a wounded, scarred planet, with gray skies and oceans choked with debris. The camera shifts to a solemn Chancellor Liora Albright, standing at a simple podium before a massive screen displaying the OWG emblem. Behind her, representatives from every surviving region of the world stand as silent witnesses.

Chancellor Albright:

"People of Earth, today I stand before you not as a ruler, but as a servant of humanity. We gather here in what remains of our cities, our nations, and our civilizations, to confront the truth of our shared history and to forge a path forward.

Our planet—this cradle of life—is dying. The wounds inflicted upon it are not the work of nature, nor the consequence of time. They are the direct result of human greed, negligence, and ignorance. Over centuries, the corporations that once promised progress and prosperity systematically drained Earth’s resources, destroyed its ecosystems, and extinguished the hopes of billions.

In the archives left behind by those who sought only power and profit, we have uncovered the full extent of their sins. Today, we share this truth with you, not to sow despair, but to lay bare the cost of complacency and to inspire action."

The Crimes of the Past

"The records show the deliberate manipulation of humanity’s future. The mega-corporations that ruled for nearly two centuries exploited every corner of this planet and every life upon it. They funded wars for resources, poisoned the air we breathe, and hoarded wealth while billions starved. But their crimes extended beyond Earth.

In their arrogance, these corporations devised schemes to control humanity’s reach beyond the stars. They sabotaged efforts to develop faster-than-light travel vessels, fearing the loss of their dominion. They buried the history of the Seed Fleets—autonomous vessels sent centuries ago to prepare distant worlds for life—because they saw no profit in revealing them to the public. Instead, they conspired to keep us tethered to a dying world, where their control remained absolute."

The Hidden Legacy of the Seed Fleets

"We have uncovered the truth of these fleets, hidden in encrypted files and forgotten repositories. Two centuries ago, while Earth’s surface burned, these ships carried the genetic blueprints of life to a hundred exoplanets. They bore with them the dream of renewal, a dream deliberately buried under layers of corporate deceit.

These worlds—our future homes—have waited in silence, seeded with the possibility of life. They stand as humanity’s hope, our chance to begin anew, and yet their existence was nearly erased from history. But no longer."

A Plan for the Future

"Today, we announce the greatest endeavor humanity has ever undertaken: Project Exodus. We will build the ships capable of carrying the remnants of humanity to these distant stars. We will leave behind this broken Earth, not in shame, but in remembrance of what was and what must never be again.

Our journey will be perilous. The construction of the Exodus fleet will demand sacrifices from all of us. Resources will be rationed, industries redirected, and priorities reconsidered. But this is not merely a plan for survival; it is a plan for redemption.

The Seed Fleets have shown us that humanity’s potential is not bound by this dying world. We will take the lessons of Earth’s destruction and build societies rooted in balance, equity, and respect for life—not in exploitation."

The Call to Unity

"To the workers of the Belt, whose toil has provided the resources for this endeavor: Your labor is not in vain. You are the architects of humanity’s future.

To the settlers of Mars, whose resilience has shown the strength of human will: Your survival is proof that even the harshest worlds can be tamed.

To the people of Earth, who have endured famine, war, and collapse: Your suffering will not be forgotten. You are the heart of this mission, the reason we must succeed.

This is not the end of humanity; it is the beginning of its rebirth. Together, as one species, we will rise from the ashes of our past mistakes. We will honor the lives lost and the lessons learned. And we will carry the spirit of Earth into the stars."

A Promise to the Future

"Let this day be remembered as the turning point. Let the horrors of our past serve as warnings to the generations yet to come. The One-World Government is not an ideal solution, nor a perfect one, but it is a necessary one. It exists to ensure that humanity does not falter again.

To those who will one day board the Exodus fleet: You carry with you the weight of our history, the dreams of those who came before, and the hope of all who remain. Do not forget this world. Carry its memory with you, so that the mistakes made here are never repeated.

Humanity’s story is not over. This is merely the closing of its first chapter. The stars await. Let us be worthy of them."
