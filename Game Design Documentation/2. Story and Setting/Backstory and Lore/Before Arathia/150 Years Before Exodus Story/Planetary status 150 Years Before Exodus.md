Earth: Environmental Collapse and Population Decline
150 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth’s ecological and social conditions worsened as the extinction level rose to 87%, marking the near-total collapse of natural ecosystems. CO2 levels surged to 3%, creating a hostile atmosphere that further reduced habitability. Corporate zones and scattered enclaves struggled to sustain the planet’s 350 million remaining inhabitants, while humanity’s focus continued to shift toward off-world expansion. Efforts to stabilize Earth’s environment were abandoned entirely, and artificial systems became the sole means of maintaining basic livability.

Population: Approximately 350 million, concentrated in isolated corporate-controlled zones and fragmented enclaves.
Presence of Liquid Water: Managed reservoirs provide limited water; most rivers and natural lakes are dry or toxic.
Chemical Environment: Soil and air toxicity remain high due to industrial pollution. Carbon dioxide: 3%, accelerating global warming and reducing oxygen availability.
Energy Sources: Nuclear and fusion energy dominate; renewable sources are almost nonexistent.
Physical Conditions: Stabilized yet dire; regions with artificial management remain habitable.
Atmospheric Composition: Oxygen: 18%. Carbon Dioxide: 3%. Nitrogen: 78%.
Climate Stability: Poor; extreme weather events persist, with frequent superstorms and heatwaves.
Radiation Protection: Ozone layer remains fragmented, exposing large regions to harmful UV radiation.
Geophysical Stability: Stable, with minimal industrial activity reducing seismic risks.
Ecosystem Support: Artificial biomes sustain Earth’s remaining biodiversity; natural ecosystems are almost entirely extinct.
Economic Indicators: Stagnant economy focused on off-world expansion; extreme inequality persists.
Military Capabilities: Privatized corporate forces dominate; Earth lacks centralized defense.
Geographical Factors: Sparse habitable zones concentrated in corporate-controlled regions; abandoned wastelands dominate the landscape.
Demographics: Aging population; youth migration to off-world colonies accelerates societal decline.
Technological Development: Focused on off-world terraforming and AI systems; Earth-based innovation is minimal.
International Relations: None; corporations function as independent global entities.
Environmental Considerations: No efforts to restore ecosystems; reliance on artificial systems for survival.
Magnetic Field: Stable but insufficient; radiation exposure remains a concern in some areas.
Geological Activity: Minimal; limited resource extraction reduces risks.

Mars: A Renewed Era of Growth
150 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars experienced a period of revitalization, with terraforming projects expanding the habitable surface to 20%. This milestone enabled the planet’s population to stabilize temporarily, reaching 12 million. Support from the Asteroid Belt provided the resources needed for large-scale planetary engineering, while advancements in atmospheric processing and radiation shielding improved living conditions. Despite these achievements, Mars’ dependency on external resources and demographic challenges foreshadowed future difficulties.

Population: Approximately 12 million, stabilized with a growing second-generation population.
Presence of Liquid Water: Controlled aquifers and reservoirs support agriculture and human needs.
Chemical Environment: The atmosphere remains CO2-dominated but is increasingly enriched with oxygen and nitrogen in habitable areas.
Energy Sources: Fusion and nuclear energy dominate; solar power supplements energy needs.
Physical Conditions: Expanded habitable zones reduce reliance on domed cities.
Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones): Oxygen: 21%. Nitrogen: 79%.
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled within domes; terraforming expands habitable zones incrementally.
Radiation Protection: Electromagnetic generators create localized shielding, enabling surface expansion.
Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining operations are regulated to prevent disruptions.
Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farming and engineered crops sustain the population.
Economic Indicators: Steady growth driven by resource imports and local innovation.
Military Capabilities: Defensive forces secure resources and maintain internal stability.
Geographical Factors: Expansion focuses on equatorial regions; polar ice is used for water extraction.
Demographics: Balanced population structure with moderate youth growth.
Technological Development: Progress in terraforming, life support, and energy efficiency.
International Relations: Cooperative relations with the Belt and orbital habitats; growing independence from Earth.
Environmental Considerations: Sustainability remains a priority to support long-term growth.
Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; artificial shielding mitigates radiation risks.
Geological Activity: Minimal; conditions support continued expansion.

The Belt: Humanity’s Industrial and Economic Hub
150 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt continued to thrive, with a population exceeding 75 million and increasingly sophisticated infrastructure supporting interstellar expansion. As the primary supplier of resources for Mars and orbital habitats, the Belt solidified its position as humanity’s industrial core. Advanced AI systems and automated mining technologies drove unprecedented economic growth, while growing autonomy from Earth-based corporations marked the Belt’s emergence as an independent political entity.

Population: Approximately 75 million, with sustained growth driven by migration and economic opportunities.
Presence of Liquid Water: Ice mining provides ample water for habitats and resource processing.
Chemical Environment: Habitats maintain Earth-like conditions with efficient recycling systems.
Energy Sources: Fusion and solar power dominate; experimental antimatter projects continue development.
Physical Conditions: Microgravity effects mitigated by health protocols and habitat rotation.
Atmospheric Composition (Habitats): Oxygen: 21%. Nitrogen: 79%.
Climate Stability: Controlled habitat environments ensure ideal living conditions.
Radiation Protection: Comprehensive shielding integrated into habitat design.
Geophysical Stability: Mining operations carefully managed to prevent structural risks.
Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponic systems and advanced biomes sustain biodiversity.
Economic Indicators: Booming economy fueled by resource extraction and innovation.
Military Capabilities: Highly advanced corporate security forces maintain stability and deter threats.
Geographical Factors: Major hubs include Ceres, Psyche, and Vesta, serving as industrial and governance centers.
Demographics: Diverse and skilled workforce; strong emphasis on research and technological development.
Technological Development: Leading advancements in AI, mining automation, and interstellar logistics.
