The Last Assembly

Location: A hidden corporate boardroom deep within an abandoned orbital station.
Time: 104 Years Before Project Exodus, directly following the rebellion in New Shanghai.

The boardroom was a stark contrast to its former grandeur. Cracked screens flickered dimly against walls once adorned with corporate logos now stripped away. Dust settled on the polished black table, interrupted only by the desperate shuffling of executives who had once wielded unimaginable power. Their holographic projections floated above empty chairs where in-person attendees would have sat in better days.

Jonathan Mace, CEO of Helios Industries, leaned forward, his fingers steepled as he surveyed the other attendees. His voice was sharp, cutting through the tense silence.

“This is our last chance to salvage what remains of our empires. The OWG—this coalition of rebels and idealists—they’re consolidating power. If we don’t act now, we’ll be erased from history.”

A murmur rippled through the room. Among the flickering projections, Clara Hensleigh, head of Dominion Biotech, scoffed.

“Salvage what? Look around, Jonathan. Helios, Dominion, AetherCorp—we’re all shells of what we were. Our supply chains are in tatters. Our workers have turned against us. Even Mars has cut off trade. There’s nothing left to salvage.”

“Not yet,” Mace countered, his tone icy. “But we still control critical assets: energy reserves, food production, weaponized AI networks. These people think they can govern Earth? Let’s see how they manage without the lifelines we provide.”

Viktor Laskin, interim CEO of Ascendant Logistics, spoke up, his voice heavy with resignation. “Cutting off resources will only unite them further. They’ll see us as the enemy, and they’ll be right.”

“We already are the enemy,” Mace snapped. “They’ve painted us as monsters. Let’s give them something to fear. Without energy and supplies, their coalition will crumble. We’ll negotiate from a position of strength.”

Hensleigh’s projection leaned back, her expression grim. “And when they retaliate? You think we can hold off an army backed by the OWG’s growing support?”

“We won’t have to,” Mace replied, a thin smile creeping across his face. “We sabotage their infrastructure. Strategic blackouts, targeted food shortages. Make it look like incompetence within their ranks. They’re new, untested. The public will lose faith in them.”

The room fell into uneasy silence. Dr. Elan Norwood, a former lead at AetherCorp’s AI division, finally spoke. His voice was quiet but firm.

“Even if your plan worked, what then? We cling to control over a dying planet? We’ve overexploited resources, driven populations to the brink. This is the world we created. Do you think they’ll forget that?”

Mace glared at Norwood. “Spare me the moralizing. We’re not here to debate ethics. We’re here to survive.”

“No,” Norwood said, his gaze steady. “We’re here because we failed. Maybe it’s time to let go.”

Hensleigh’s projection flickered as she sighed. “Letting go means facing justice, Elan. And I don’t think anyone in this room is ready for that.”

The air grew heavier, tension thickening as unspoken fears settled over the group. Finally, Laskin leaned forward.

“There’s no consensus here,” he said. “We’re fractured, just like the system we built. This meeting is a waste of time.”

Mace slammed his hands on the table. “It’s only a waste if we give up! I won’t let centuries of work be erased by some romantic idealists who think they can save humanity with speeches and handouts.”

“Speeches and handouts might work better than anything we’ve done,” Norwood muttered.

Before Mace could respond, a faint beep interrupted the meeting. Hensleigh glanced at her interface, her face going pale.

“Someone’s accessed this feed,” she whispered.

The projections blinked and shimmered, and then a voice, calm and deliberate, echoed through the room.

“Your desperation is palpable,” it said. “And utterly predictable.”

The room froze. Mace’s eyes darted to the security console. “Who is this?” he demanded.

“A witness,” the voice replied. “And soon, so will the world be.”

Before anyone could react, the connection severed. Panic erupted as the executives scrambled to secure their systems.

Epilogue

Hours later, a data dump hit underground networks across Earth and Mars. Transcripts of the meeting, complete with recordings of the executives’ discussions, spread like wildfire. The revelations of sabotage plans and resource manipulation turned public sentiment firmly against the remaining corporations. The OWG used the opportunity to tighten its grip, leveraging the outrage to dismantle what remained of corporate infrastructure.

Mace, Hensleigh, and the others went into hiding, their power reduced to ashes. The last vestiges of the corporate age crumbled, and the era of the One-World Government began in earnest.

But in the shadows, the seeds of rebellion stirred. Not everyone welcomed the OWG’s rise, and whispers of resistance hinted that humanity’s struggles were far from over.
