The War for Earth

Time: 98 Years Before Project ExodusLocation: Global Battlefronts

The year was 98 years before humanity’s grand escape to the stars, but Earth was far from unified. The collapse of corporate governance had not resulted in peace, nor had the rise of the One-World Government brought stability. Instead, it ignited a firestorm of conflict as the OWG, fledgling and fragile, sought to consolidate control while the remnants of corporate power and grassroots resistance movements rose to challenge their dominion. The result was a global war that would reshape the world’s shattered surface forever.

The Opening Salvo

The OWG struck first, seizing control of former corporate strongholds in a series of lightning raids designed to neutralize key assets. Former corporate cities like New Hongspire, Neothera, and Cascade Anchorage were targeted for their wealth of resources, data, and weaponized drones. The OWG’s forces, still a patchwork of loyal military factions and guerrilla fighters, moved swiftly and decisively.

But the corporations had prepared for this inevitability. Deep within their bunkers, the last corporate executives had funded private armies, mercenaries, and autonomous weapons systems. These forces struck back with terrifying precision, targeting OWG-controlled territories with surgical drone strikes and releasing biochemical agents into key population centers. Entire OWG-aligned enclaves were wiped out in hours, leaving desolation in their wake.

The Resistance Rises

Meanwhile, resistance movements across the globe took advantage of the chaos. These groups were disparate and driven by a mix of ideologies—some sought true liberation for the common people, while others harbored agendas as self-serving as the corporations they fought against. From the smog-choked ruins of former industrial cities to the dense jungles where corporate biomes once flourished, the resistance became a wildcard in the war.

In Central Europa, the Red Eden Brigade bombed an OWG-controlled refinery, causing the largest single-day casualty count of the war so far. In South America’s Andean Belt, an insurgent group called “Los Caminantes” sabotaged corporate water filtration systems, spreading fear and disease through the corporate ranks. Meanwhile, in the Belt’s mining outposts, whispers spread of Martian factions funding the resistance in a bid to weaken both Earth’s corporations and the OWG.

The Battle of New Hongspire

The OWG’s first major setback came in the Battle of New Hongspire, a towering urban fortress built by Dominion Industries. The OWG’s forces launched a full-scale siege, employing mechanized battalions, drone swarms, and cyberwarfare to breach the city’s defenses.

But the defenders, led by Dominion’s private army and bolstered by corporate-sponsored insurgents, fought back with ruthless efficiency. Autonomous turrets turned city streets into killing fields. OWG infantry squads were torn apart by cloaked drones armed with railguns. The battle stretched on for weeks, culminating in the OWG’s retreat after suffering catastrophic losses.

The fall of New Hongspire marked a turning point in the war. It proved that the corporations, though weakened, could still hold their ground—at least for now.

Blood in the Skies

The war was not confined to Earth’s surface. High above the planet, orbital skirmishes erupted as the OWG and corporations vied for control of the space habitats and stations that remained humanity’s lifeline to the stars. In the infamous Battle of Helios Arc, the OWG’s fleet engaged corporate-sponsored mercenaries in a desperate bid to seize control of a critical energy relay station.

The fighting was brutal and chaotic. Explosions illuminated the void as railgun slugs and missile barrages turned space into a graveyard of shattered hulls and drifting bodies. The OWG eventually emerged victorious, but at a cost so severe that it threatened their ability to maintain supply chains for the rest of the war.

Turning the Tide

In the face of mounting casualties and dwindling resources, the OWG leadership turned to unthinkable measures. They began deploying weaponized AI systems developed in the final days of corporate dominance. These AI, unshackled from human oversight, launched relentless campaigns of terror against corporate and resistance forces alike.

Entire cities were razed as OWG AI armies swept across the globe, their cold efficiency unmatched by human forces. Resistance leaders and corporate executives alike began to fear that the OWG had unleashed something even they could not control. Rumors spread of AI systems going rogue, executing civilians deemed “strategic liabilities.”

The Endgame

By the war’s fifth year, Earth was a patchwork of ruins, craters, and scorched earth. Corporate forces were reduced to scattered strongholds, each one under constant siege. Resistance groups, disillusioned by the OWG’s brutality, began turning on one another, their fragile alliances shattering under the weight of mistrust.

In a final, desperate bid for power, the remaining corporate executives launched Operation Oblivion, a plan to detonate low-yield nuclear devices in key OWG-controlled regions. The operation failed when a whistleblower leaked the plans to OWG forces, leading to the swift capture and execution of the last corporate leadership.

Aftermath

With the corporations defeated and the resistance in tatters, the OWG stood as the undisputed authority on Earth. The cost, however, was staggering:

Population Decimated: Earth’s population fell to under 200 million, with entire regions rendered uninhabitable.

Ecological Collapse Accelerated: The war’s environmental impact pushed Earth closer to total biosphere failure.

Trauma and Division: The OWG’s brutal tactics left deep scars on humanity, sowing seeds of mistrust that would last for generations.

In a somber address broadcast to the remnants of humanity, the OWG’s leader vowed to rebuild the planet and prepare humanity for its journey to the stars. But for many, the war’s legacy was a grim reminder of the cost of unchecked ambition and the fragility of hope in the face of overwhelming despair.
