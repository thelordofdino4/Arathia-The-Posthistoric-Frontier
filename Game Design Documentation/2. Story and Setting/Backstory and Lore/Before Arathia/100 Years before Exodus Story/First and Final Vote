First and Final Vote

Time: 97 Years Before Project ExodusLocation: Hope’s Bastion, a remote enclave in the former Rocky Mountains

The community hall of Hope’s Bastion, nestled in the shadow of a jagged mountain range, was crowded with its remaining citizens. The air was thick with tension and the faint scent of wood smoke from the stoves that kept the hall warm. Outside, snow fell in heavy flakes, muffling the world beyond the enclave. Inside, the voices of debate grew louder, echoing off the wooden walls.

A rusted metal plaque above the hall’s entrance bore the words: Founded 2795 - Hope’s Bastion, Where Freedom Lives. It was a bitter irony that this meeting would determine whether the enclave’s cherished independence would end.

The Debate

“We can’t keep going like this!” shouted Maren Tull, a wiry farmer with a weathered face and calloused hands. “Our crops barely feed us. The generators are on their last legs. Winter’s here, and we don’t even have enough fuel to last another month. The OWG is offering stability. We can’t turn that down.”

“And what will it cost us?” retorted Callum Pryce, a former historian turned the enclave’s makeshift teacher. His voice cracked with urgency. “They’ll strip us of what little freedom we have left. They’ll ration our food, dictate our work, monitor our lives. Are we really ready to trade liberty for stability?”

The crowd murmured in agreement, though the sentiment was split. Some nodded solemnly with Maren, their faces etched with the weariness of survival. Others clenched their fists, aligning with Callum’s defiance.

At the head of the hall, Sarah Hartman, Hope’s Bastion’s de facto leader, stood silently. A former engineer, she had been instrumental in keeping the enclave running through its many crises. Now, she struggled to find the words that might unite her divided people.

A Message from the OWG

The clattering hum of an old projector cut through the noise as Sarah powered it on. The screen flickered to life, showing a pre-recorded message from the OWG’s provisional council. The faces of the newly appointed leaders filled the screen, their expressions grave yet hopeful.

“Citizens of Earth,” began Eamon Voss, the council’s chosen spokesperson. His deep voice resonated with calm authority. “The corporate era is over. The wars are over. We stand now at the threshold of rebuilding a world not ruled by greed, but by unity and survival.”

He paused, letting the words sink in. “We understand the sacrifices you have made. We know the wounds left by this long conflict will not heal overnight. But we promise you this: the One-World Government will dedicate itself to restoring stability, security, and dignity to every corner of this fractured Earth.”

As the message ended, Sarah turned off the projector. The silence that followed was deafening.

The Final Argument

Sarah finally spoke, her voice measured but firm. “This isn’t just about today or tomorrow. It’s about the next generation, and the one after that. If we join the OWG, we might lose some of what makes Hope’s Bastion unique. But we’ll gain access to food, medicine, protection. Things we can’t provide for ourselves anymore.”

Callum’s voice rose again. “And if we give in, we’ll become just another cog in their machine. They say unity, but what they mean is control. What happens to our voices, our choices? Once we’re in, there’s no going back.”

Maren stepped forward, addressing the crowd. “What good is freedom if we don’t survive the winter? My kids go to bed hungry every night. Do you know what that feels like? If the OWG can help, I’ll take their rules. I’ll take anything.”

The hall erupted in a cacophony of voices. Pleas for survival clashed with cries of defiance, creating a storm of conflicting emotions.

The Vote

Sarah raised her hand, and gradually, the room fell quiet. “We’ll put it to a vote. This is still a democracy, and this decision belongs to all of us.”

The ballots were simple slips of paper. Each citizen wrote one word: Join or Remain. The voting process was tense, the weight of every decision palpable. When the votes were tallied, Sarah read the result aloud:

“By a margin of three votes, Hope’s Bastion will join the OWG.”

A stunned silence hung over the room. Some wept with relief; others stared in disbelief. Callum leaned against the wall, his face pale but resigned. Maren hugged her children tightly, tears streaming down her face.

Fractured Unity

That night, Hope’s Bastion was quiet. The celebrations were subdued, the arguments left unresolved. A few families packed their belongings, preparing to leave the enclave rather than submit to OWG rule. Sarah watched them go, her heart heavy.

The following morning, an OWG envoy arrived with supplies and instructions. The flag of Hope’s Bastion was lowered, replaced by the OWG’s stark emblem. For many, it was a moment of profound loss—the end of an identity they had fought so hard to preserve.

But for others, it was a beginning. A fragile hope flickered that perhaps, with the OWG’s help, they could rebuild not just their enclave, but a future worth living for.

Epilogue

Years later, in a quiet corner of the enclave, Callum Pryce buried a small chest containing the old flag of Hope’s Bastion and a handwritten journal chronicling their history. Above it, he planted a single marker: For those who remember—and those who will.
