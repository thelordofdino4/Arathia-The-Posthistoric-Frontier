The Origins of the One-World Government

Location: An underground enclave beneath the ruins of GenevaTime: 105 Years Before Project Exodus

The room was dimly lit, the hum of old machinery providing a faint backdrop to the urgent whispers and debates. In the shadow of the once-proud United Nations headquarters, now a crumbling monument to a bygone era, a new coalition of leaders gathered in secret. They were scientists, engineers, military strategists, and the few remaining visionaries who had not yet succumbed to despair. Among them, the names of past heroes were spoken like prayers—Nora Vale, Elias Cormack, Vanessa Marlowe. Their legacy loomed large over the proceedings, a reminder of what humanity had lost and what it still might reclaim.

Dr. Serena Hyland, a climatologist who had spent her career studying the ecological collapse of Earth, stood at the head of the table. Her face was lined with exhaustion, but her eyes burned with purpose. She raised her voice over the murmurs.

“Enough arguing! Look around you. This is all that’s left of global leadership: a handful of enclaves, fractured corporate holdings, and a population that’s given up hope. The corporations have gutted this planet. They’ve failed us all. If we don’t unite now, there won’t be anyone left to save.”

General Tomas Veyra, a stoic military leader, leaned forward, his voice gravelly but steady. “And you propose what? Martial law? Forced compliance? That won’t work. The people are broken, Serena. They won’t rally to another boot on their necks.”

Adira Korvell, an engineer and former corporate whistleblower, interjected. “Not if they see us as another oppressive regime. We need to be different. We need to inspire them, not control them.”

The room fell silent as Korvell’s words hung in the air. For years, she had risked her life exposing corporate malfeasance, drawing on the examples set by figures like Elias Cormack and Angela Cross. She had seen firsthand how corporate greed consumed the Belt and poisoned Mars, and she was determined not to let Earth meet the same fate.

“We have the means,” she continued. “The knowledge left behind by those who came before us. We know how to rebuild infrastructure, stabilize food production, and harness what’s left of the planet’s resources. But we can’t do it alone. The people need to believe that this isn’t just another power grab.”

Father Emil Renard, a former priest turned activist, nodded solemnly. “They need a symbol of hope. Something that says we’re fighting for more than survival. Something that reminds them of the ideals that Nora Vale and Elias Cormack stood for—sacrifice, resilience, and the greater good.”

Hyland gestured to a battered holoprojector at the center of the table. It flickered to life, displaying a map of Earth, its once-vibrant colors now muted and scarred by the wounds of ecological collapse.

“The corporations won’t go down without a fight,” she said. “They’ll frame us as terrorists, anarchists. They’ll use every ounce of their remaining power to crush us. But if we stay fragmented, we’re already dead. We need to unite under a single banner. A global authority that can bring order out of chaos and prepare us for the future.”

General Veyra crossed his arms. “A single banner sounds a lot like tyranny, Serena.”

Adira Korvell shot him a sharp glance. “Tyranny is what we have now. This is about survival. If we don’t act, there won’t be anyone left to govern.”

Renard stood, his voice calm but filled with conviction. “If we move forward with this, we must carry the weight of every decision carefully. We cannot forget the mistakes of the past. We must remember Nora Vale’s warning: power without accountability is a poison. If we abuse this responsibility, we’re no better than the corporations we’re fighting against.”

Hyland looked around the table, her gaze settling on each of them. “Then we do it together. No single leader, no unchecked authority. We share the burden, and we hold each other accountable. Agreed?”

One by one, the members of the room nodded. Some reluctantly, others with quiet determination.

“What do we call this new authority?” asked Korvell.

Renard smiled faintly. “The One-World Government. It’s not about erasing nations or cultures. It’s about reminding people that we are one species, on one planet, with one chance to make this right.”

Climactic Event

The decision to form the OWG was not met with universal support. As word of the coalition spread, corporate forces mobilized, launching targeted strikes against key infrastructure. In one particularly devastating attack, the corporations destroyed an artificial biome in the Pacific designed to support Earth’s remaining biodiversity.

General Veyra’s forces responded swiftly, repelling the attackers but at great cost. The assault galvanized public opinion, however, as footage of the destroyed biome and Veyra’s defense circulated through underground channels.

In a rousing speech broadcast from the ruins of Geneva, Hyland addressed the world:

“We will not let this be the end. For too long, humanity has allowed greed and division to rule us. No more. Today, we stand together as one people, under one cause: to save what remains of our world and prepare for the stars. The corporations thought they could break us, but they’ve only strengthened our resolve. This is our last chance. Let’s not waste it.”

The speech became a rallying cry, and the OWG solidified its support among Earth’s scattered populations. The era of corporate domination had ended, and the age of the One-World Government had begun.
