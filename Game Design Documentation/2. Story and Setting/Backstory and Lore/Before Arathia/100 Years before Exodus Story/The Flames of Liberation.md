Title: The Flames of Liberation

Location: New Detroit, Earth’s last corporate stronghold under Helios Industries
Time: 100 Years Before Project Exodus

The streets of New Detroit burned with desperation. Smoke rose from shattered storefronts as workers, fed up with years of exploitation and deprivation, stormed the industrial heart of the city. Helios Industries, once a symbol of corporate dominance, had turned the city into a factory for the elite’s survival, leaving the labor force to toil in squalor for rationed water and recycled food.

Chapter 1: Seeds of Defiance

Malik Jansen crouched behind a derelict hover tram, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He adjusted his grip on the battered stun rifle he had taken from a fallen Helios security officer. The insignia on his own enforcer jacket—a golden sun emblazoned with the Helios emblem—seemed to mock him as he gazed at the chaos unfolding. The workers were winning.

Above the din of the rebellion, Malik heard the voice of Cara Reyes, the movement’s de facto leader, echoing through the city’s broken loudspeaker system.

“Brothers and sisters, this is our time! Helios has robbed us of our futures for too long. We take back what is ours, or we die trying!”

Malik swallowed hard, remembering the faces of the workers he had once subdued with brutal efficiency. Helios had promised him protection, power, and a sense of purpose. All lies, he realized, as he watched people rally under a tattered banner painted with the words: Free New Detroit.

Chapter 2: A Question of Loyalty

Later that night, Malik slipped into a rebel-controlled warehouse on the outskirts of the industrial zone. The air inside was thick with the smell of burnt circuitry and hastily prepared explosives. Cara stood at the center of the room, surrounded by makeshift maps and tense faces. Her eyes narrowed when she spotted him.

“You’ve got some nerve showing up here, Jansen,” she said, her voice low and dangerous.

“I’m not here to fight you,” Malik replied, raising his hands. “I’m here because you’re right. I’ve been on the wrong side of this for too long.”

“And why should we trust you?” asked Davion Kline, a burly mechanic gripping a steel wrench like a weapon. “You’ve spent years cracking skulls for Helios.”

“Because I know their playbook,” Malik said. “I know their weaknesses. And I know how to hit them where it hurts.”

The room fell silent as Cara studied him. Finally, she nodded. “You’ve got one chance. Don’t make me regret this.”

Chapter 3: Striking the Heart

Under Malik’s guidance, the rebels targeted Helios’ main supply hub: a sprawling facility housing food, water, and medical supplies—the lifeline of New Detroit’s labor force. Securing it would be a death blow to Helios’ grip on the city.

The assault began at dawn. Smoke grenades and EMP bursts disabled the facility’s automated defenses, while rebel forces overwhelmed the remaining guards. Malik led a small team through the maintenance tunnels, bypassing security checkpoints and opening gates for the main force.

As they reached the central depot, Cara’s voice came through the comms. “We’ve got the supplies. Helios forces are retreating. This is it, people. New Detroit is ours!”

Cheers erupted, but Malik felt no triumph. Victory had come at a cost: dozens of rebels lay dead or wounded, and the city’s infrastructure was in shambles. And then, the OWG arrived.

Chapter 4: The New Order

OWG drones appeared first, their sleek black forms hovering ominously over the captured supply hub. Moments later, Colonel Evander Rourke, an OWG representative, appeared via holographic projection. His cold gaze swept over the rebel leaders gathered in the depot.

“Congratulations on your victory,” Rourke said, his tone devoid of warmth. “Helios’ reign over New Detroit is over. As of this moment, the city is under OWG jurisdiction.”

“Jurisdiction?” Cara stepped forward, fists clenched. “We bled for this city. We won it. You don’t get to just take it.”

Rourke raised an eyebrow. “Without us, you have no chance of holding it. The OWG will stabilize New Detroit, distribute these supplies fairly, and prevent further bloodshed. Or would you prefer to face Helios’ retaliation alone?”

The room fell into tense silence. Malik could see the frustration etched into Cara’s face. The OWG’s offer wasn’t a choice; it was an ultimatum.

Chapter 5: The Cost of Freedom

As the OWG forces moved in, Malik found Cara sitting on a crate, staring at the city’s skyline.

“This isn’t what we fought for,” she said bitterly.

“Maybe not,” Malik replied, sitting beside her. “But it’s a step. Helios is gone. The people have a chance now. It’s not perfect, but it’s something.”

Cara looked at him, her expression softening. “You think they’ll let us build something better?”

“I think we’ve shown that we can fight for it,” Malik said. “And maybe that’s enough for now.”

As the sun set over New Detroit, the city stood at a crossroads. The rebels had won their freedom, but the price was a fragile alliance with a new power. For Malik, Cara, and the people of New Detroit, the fight was far from over.
