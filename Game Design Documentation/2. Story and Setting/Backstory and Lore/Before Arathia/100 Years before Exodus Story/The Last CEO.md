The Last CEO

Time: 98 Years Before Project ExodusLocation: Apex Dynamics Corporate Headquarters, New Hongspire

The skyline of New Hongspire, once a symbol of corporate dominance, was now a shattered monument to hubris. Fires raged unchecked, casting an orange glow against the toxic sky. Artillery blasts echoed through the city’s hollowed streets as the Third Battle for New Hongspire reached its crescendo. Apex Dynamics, the last bastion of corporate power, stood at the center of the chaos. And within its highest tower, Scott Smith, the last CEO, stared at the crumbling remnants of his empire.

The office was a wasteland of shattered glass and toppled furniture. Holographic displays blinked weakly, listing the same grim updates:

Eastern Sector Breached

Supply Lines Severed

Inner Defenses Collapsing

Chief Strategist Ethan Suri paced like a caged animal. His suit was disheveled, his tie loosened. "Scott, we need to leave now! The private transport is waiting!"

Scott didn’t turn from the window. His reflection looked hollow, his once commanding frame diminished by exhaustion. "Leave to where, Ethan? Mars? The Belt? Another fortress where we can watch everything fall apart again?"

"Anywhere but here!" Ethan barked. "You can’t help anyone if you’re dead."

Scott finally turned, his expression unreadable. "Help?" he repeated, his voice laced with irony. "I don’t think ‘help’ is what we’ve ever done, Ethan."

Reckoning With the Past

Scott activated a console embedded in the wall. A holographic archive flickered to life, displaying Apex Dynamics at its peak: glittering metropolises, sprawling orbital stations, and technological marvels. The images felt like ghostly remnants of a bygone era.

"We built this," Scott said, his voice heavy. "All of it. On the backs of billions. We promised progress, but we left ruin."

"We’re not the only ones responsible," Ethan said cautiously. "The system—"

"We are the system," Scott interrupted sharply. "Every resource plundered, every life lost—it all led here."

Ethan paused, then took a step closer. "So what now? Are you going to martyr yourself for redemption?"

Scott smiled faintly, a bitter twist of his lips. "Redemption isn’t in the cards. But maybe there’s still time to stop this cycle."

The OWG’s Ultimatum

A chime broke the tense silence. Scott gestured to accept the incoming transmission. A young OWG envoy appeared on the screen, his polished uniform and clipped tone radiating smug authority.

"Mr. Smith," the envoy began, "this is your final opportunity to surrender Apex Dynamics’ resources and infrastructure to the One-World Government. In return, you will be granted clemency."

Ethan scoffed. "Clemency? Is that what you call forced assimilation?"

The envoy’s smile didn’t falter. "The alternative is annihilation. The OWG has no need for holdouts."

Scott studied the envoy for a long moment before cutting the feed. "Draft a reply," he said flatly. "It will be ready soon."

The Final Choice

Scott descended into Apex’s secure vaults. Rows of servers glowed dimly, holding the sum total of the corporation’s knowledge and sins. He approached the central terminal, inserting a data drive. Streams of information—blueprints, logistical frameworks, advanced AI protocols—flowed toward OWG-controlled servers. Yet one partition, labeled "Restricted," remained untouched. These were Apex’s darkest secrets: weaponized AI, bioweapons, terraforming projects that had devastated entire regions.

Scott hesitated, his fingers hovering over the controls. "Not these," he muttered. "Not ever."

With a single keystroke, he initiated a full purge. Sparks flew as the system overloaded, obliterating the data beyond recovery. He stood there a moment longer, watching the destruction as if it were penance.

The Battle Above

The city shuddered as another barrage of explosions rocked its foundations. OWG forces poured into the streets, their mechanized units overwhelming Apex’s last defenses. Drones filled the sky, and autonomous tanks rolled through smoldering barricades. The final hours of New Hongspire were marked by unrelenting carnage.

Ethan burst into the vault, panting. "Scott! They’ve breached the inner perimeter! We have to leave now!"

Scott turned, holding a small lockbox. "Let’s go."

The two men fled through the labyrinthine corridors of Apex Dynamics, the sounds of battle echoing closer with each step. They boarded a waiting transport as gunfire erupted nearby.

A Legacy of Ruin

As the transport ascended, Scott watched New Hongspire fade into the distance. Fires consumed the skyline, and OWG banners rose above the wreckage. He felt no triumph, no sorrow—only a hollow acceptance.

"Where to, Mr. Smith?" the pilot asked.

Scott’s gaze remained fixed on the burning city. "Anywhere that still has hope," he said quietly.

Far below, the Third Battle for New Hongspire came to an end. The OWG claimed victory, solidifying its dominance over Earth. For Scott Smith, the last CEO, there was no victory. Only the burden of a legacy steeped in exploitation and the faint hope that perhaps, in the ashes of his empire, something better might rise.
