Earth: A Planet Under Unified Rule
100 Years Before Project Exodus

With Earth’s CO2 levels reaching 4.8% and over 91% of its species extinct, the planet entered its final stages as a habitable world. The collapse of mega-corporations gave rise to the One-World Government (OWG), an authoritarian regime tasked with stabilizing Earth’s population and preparing for humanity’s eventual migration to the stars. While the OWG succeeded in halting Earth’s decline, its methods fostered resentment and despair among the remaining 300 million inhabitants.

Population: Approximately 300 million, concentrated in urban enclaves under strict governmental control.
Presence of Liquid Water: Restricted to artificial reservoirs and managed aquifers; natural sources are largely polluted or depleted.
Chemical Environment: Toxicity remains high in urban zones, with air and soil contamination widespread.
Energy Sources: Transition to renewable energy accelerates; nuclear and fusion dominate global power grids.
Physical Conditions: Stabilized but harsh; artificial ecosystems sustain biodiversity, and large regions remain uninhabitable.
Atmospheric Composition: Oxygen: 17%, Carbon Dioxide: 4.8%, Nitrogen: 78%.
Climate Stability: Marginal; extreme weather events persist due to elevated CO2 levels.
Radiation Protection: Fragmented ozone layer exacerbates UV exposure in unprotected regions.
Geophysical Stability: Stable; industrial activity has declined, reducing seismic and extraction-related risks.
Ecosystem Support: Artificial biomes support the remaining biodiversity; natural ecosystems are nearly extinct.
Economic Indicators: Centrally planned economy prioritizing survival and space migration.
Military Capabilities: Centralized under the OWG, with military forces focused on maintaining order and securing resources.
Geographical Factors: Urban zones dominate habitable regions; rural areas are largely abandoned or serve as resource extraction hubs.
Demographics: Aging population with limited growth due to strict reproductive controls.
Technological Development: Focused on space exploration, terraforming research, and synthetic ecosystems.
International Relations: Nonexistent; the OWG governs all geopolitical interactions.
Environmental Considerations: Restoration projects are deprioritized in favor of survival and migration efforts.
Magnetic Field: Stable but inadequate; radiation exposure remains a concern in unshielded areas.
Geological Activity: Minimal due to the cessation of large-scale industrial extraction.

Mars: A Thriving Frontier
100 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars entered a new era of expansion, with terraforming advancing to the point where much of the planet’s equatorial region became walkable without protective suits or oxygen tanks. Only unshielded areas required temporary aid. With its population exceeding 20 million, Mars became humanity’s primary stronghold, showcasing advancements in terraforming, energy generation, and ecological engineering.

Population: Approximately 20 million, bolstered by migration and natural growth.
Presence of Liquid Water: Extensive reservoirs and controlled aquifers support a growing population and agriculture.
Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated atmosphere outside terraformed zones; oxygen levels near the equator allow unassisted human activity.
Energy Sources: Fusion and solar power dominate; localized wind farms supplement energy needs.
Physical Conditions: Significant areas near the equator allow for unassisted human movement, with only occasional need for oxygen tanks or suits.
Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones): Oxygen: 21%, Nitrogen: 79%.
Atmospheric Composition (Equatorial Regions): Oxygen: 15%, CO2: 3%.
Climate Stability: Terraforming has created localized stability; equatorial regions support extended outdoor activity.
Radiation Protection: Electromagnetic shielding covers the majority of surface settlements.
Geophysical Stability: Stable; terraforming projects are carefully managed to prevent disruptions.
Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponic and soil-based agriculture; introduction of Earth-adapted flora and fauna into managed ecosystems.
Economic Indicators: Thriving; resource independence and internal innovation drive growth.
Military Capabilities: Defensive and cooperative forces maintain stability and resource security.
Geographical Factors: Expansion continues across equatorial regions; polar areas remain resource extraction hubs.
Demographics: Balanced and diverse population with a growing younger generation.
Technological Development: Advanced in terraforming, life support, and interstellar transport technology.
International Relations: Strong ties with the Asteroid Belt and orbital habitats; growing independence from Earth’s OWG.
Environmental Considerations: Sustainability remains central to Martian policies, ensuring long-term growth.
Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; reliance on artificial shielding persists.
Geological Activity: Minimal, with stable conditions for expansion and habitation.

The Belt: Humanity’s Industrial Engine
100 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt remained humanity’s economic powerhouse, with its population surpassing 80 million. Advanced mining operations, self-sufficient habitats, and cutting-edge technologies positioned the Belt as a critical player in humanity’s interstellar ambitions.
