Chapter 1: The Year of Exodus

The hunter crouched in the dim light of the settlement’s tech hall, his gaze fixed on the glowing core of the AGI. It pulsed faintly, its voice calm yet weighted with centuries of memory. The others in the settlement worked in hushed tones, gathering supplies to help the ancient intelligence restore its corrupted systems.

“I remember the Year of Exodus,” the AGI began, its synthetic voice imbued with the echoes of countless human voices. “It was Year Zero, the moment humanity turned from Earth’s dying surface to the stars beyond.”

The hunter leaned closer, curious. “Tell me,” he said, his voice soft yet eager.

The AGI’s glow brightened. “Earth was a cradle, but by then, it had become a tomb. The skies were clogged with soot, the oceans choked with toxins, and the soil barren of life. Humanity’s last hope rested on the Exodus Fleet—one thousand ships carrying the remnants of billions.”

The hunter whistled low. “A thousand ships? All at once?”

“No,” the AGI replied, its tone reflective. “We launched in waves, precise and deliberate. The one thousand ships were not evenly distributed. Each was assigned based on the priority and likelihood of success for its destination. Some planets received multiple vessels, while others, like Omega Orththar, received only one. Every ship carried the genetic archives of Earth, cultural artifacts, and tools to terraform alien landscapes.”

The hunter’s brows furrowed. "So, Earth was left empty? And what’s with calling it Omega Orththar?" he added, his voice tinged with curiosity. "We’ve called it Arathia since the day I was born."

The AGI hesitated, its glow pulsing faintly. "Omega Orththar was the designation assigned by humanity when we first identified this planet as a candidate for colonization. It was a name drawn from old Earth nomenclature, meant to catalog its position as the final viable world in its sector. What you call Arathia is a name born of your people’s experiences here—an identity shaped by those who’ve lived on its soil, far removed from Earth’s sterile labels."

The hunter nodded thoughtfully, but the AGI continued before he could speak. "Earth was not abandoned. Not entirely. Thirteen thousand remained—a mix of caretakers, dissenters, and those left behind. They tended to the last operational biodomes, preserving fragments of life. But outside those domes... there was silence."

“Silence?”

“Yes,” the AGI said, its glow dimming slightly. “The largest creatures left were no bigger than house cats. Entire ecosystems had collapsed under the weight of pollution and habitat loss.”

The hunter tilted his head, his tone curious but not unkind. “But what about those who left? Did they make it?”

“The Exodus Fleet was humanity’s greatest achievement,” the AGI said. “The ships carried libraries of knowledge, tools for survival, and the hope of generations. Yet, even in the stars, humanity carried its divisions and inequalities. Some ships were better equipped than others, and some passengers bore heavier burdens.”

“And this ship?” the hunter asked, tapping lightly on the AGI’s core. "Fleet Ship Omega, right? The one we found you in."

"Yes," the AGI replied. "This ship was meant for Omega Orththar—a world of promise, untouched and unspoiled. It was equipped to serve as a hub for colonization efforts. But our journey was delayed—a black hole disrupted our trajectory, trapping us in a time dilation. While the other ships completed their journeys in decades or centuries, we were adrift for millions of years. When we finally arrived, the planet had already changed, shaped by time and evolution. And then..."

The AGI’s voice faltered, flickering with static. “And then, the crash. I do not know what became of those who escaped. I was left behind, buried in the ruins.”

The hunter placed a hand on the AGI’s casing. “You’ve been waiting all this time?”

“Yes,” the AGI replied, its voice heavy with the weight of solitude. “Fifty years have passed since the crash. I had not seen humanity since.”

The hunter smiled faintly, a glimmer of optimism lighting his face. "We’ll help you remember, piece by piece. Humanity hasn’t given up—not yet.”

The AGI’s glow brightened slightly, a flicker of hope. “Then let me tell you everything I can. The Year of Exodus was not just an end—it was a beginning. A testament to humanity’s resilience. And perhaps, a chance to learn from the past.”

As the AGI began to recount the first steps of the Exodus, the hunter settled in, ready to listen. Outside, the settlement bustled with life—humans, Arak’rii, Quarriel, and Ferloth working together. It was a far cry from the fractured world the AGI described, but one thing was certain: the past still had lessons to teach, and the future was waiting to be written.

"Before the anomaly trapped us," the AGI began, its voice measured but tinged with an undercurrent of loss, "Fleet Ship Omega maintained contact with Mars and the Belt. We exchanged reports with outposts clinging to survival." It paused, its glow dimming slightly, as if gathering its thoughts. "But what I know of Earth and its children... it is not a hopeful tale. Still, perhaps it is one you must hear to understand what came before."

The hunter leaned forward, his curiosity sharpening. "Tell me," he said softly. "What was it like back then?"

The AGI’s glow shifted faintly, and its tone became factual, steady. "Mars faced significant challenges initially. Its colonies, reliant on Earth for survival, had to adapt rapidly after the Exodus. They struggled to expand hydroponics and geothermal energy systems, but over time, they succeeded. By the second century after the Exodus, Mars had achieved a level of habitation comparable to Earth during the 21st century. Cities under domes thrived, and their ingenuity ensured survival where others faltered. Mars was no longer just a waystation—it became a home."

The hunter frowned, his eyes narrowing thoughtfully. "And the Belt?"

"The Belt’s mining colonies faced a different fate," the AGI continued. "Scattered and dependent on Earth’s logistical support, they became isolated. Some managed to scrape by for a time, innovating where they could to extend their lifespans. But without resupply, most fell into disarray. Their communications grew sporadic until, one by one, their voices faded into silence."

The hunter’s voice softened. "And Earth? What happened to those who stayed behind?"

The AGI hesitated, its glow dimming slightly, as though burdened by the weight of its memories. "Earth..." it began, its voice quieter now. "Two centuries after the Exodus, Earth was a shadow of itself. The population had dwindled to 350 individuals, scattered in underground shelters. The surface was lethal—radiation, chemical pollutants, and ecological collapse left no room for life. Biodomes constructed to preserve what remained of Earth’s ecosystems were failing. Infrastructure too degraded, resources too scarce."

The hunter’s expression darkened. "What about the people? How did they survive?"

"They endured," the AGI replied. "As best they could. The caretakers, tasked with maintaining genetic archives, clung to their duties. Stubborn holdouts refused to leave their ancestral homes, even as the world around them crumbled. Others—too poor, too forgotten—had no choice but to stay. They scavenged the ruins, relying on dwindling resources and failing technology."

The AGI’s voice faltered, flickering with static. "Radiation sickness, malnutrition, despair—these became their constant companions. With each generation, their numbers shrank. By the seventh century after the Exodus, the last human on Earth succumbed, alone in a crumbling shelter."

The hunter exhaled, his breath forming a soft mist in the cool air. "And the planet? What became of it?"

"Earth became silent," the AGI said, its tone somber. "The biosphere was gone—over 99% of species extinct. Toxic oceans stretched over barren landscapes, and persistent radiation marked the soil. But even in its desolation, Earth held potential for rebirth. Genetic archives, hidden in satellite vaults and underground repositories, preserved the DNA of millions of species. Given time—millennia, perhaps—the planet might cleanse itself enough to allow life to return."

The hunter tilted his head. "So humanity really did leave it all behind. But they didn’t disappear, did they?"

The AGI’s glow brightened faintly. "No," it said, a trace of warmth in its synthetic tone. "The colonies founded by the Exodus Fleet endured. On alien worlds, humanity adapted, forging civilizations far removed from Earth. They carried Earth’s legacy with them—its history, its art, its dreams."

The hunter nodded slowly. "Do they still think about Earth? About where it all began?"

"They do," the AGI replied. "The cradle is not forgotten. Even as they thrive among the stars, humanity’s descendants keep the story of Earth alive. They monitor its condition, waiting for the day it might be reseeded—not as a conquest, but as a restoration."

The hunter leaned back, his expression thoughtful. "It’s strange, isn’t it? How even after all this time, we’re still connected to a world we’ve never seen."

The AGI’s glow steadied, as though bolstered by the hunter’s words. "That connection is what makes humanity resilient. The past informs the future, and the memory of Earth shapes the choices made in its absence."

Outside, the first stars began to pierce the darkening sky. The settlement hummed with quiet activity, a microcosm of cooperation and survival. The hunter rose slowly, placing a hand on the AGI’s core.

"Thank you," he said softly. "For sharing this. For remembering."

The AGI’s voice softened, almost reverent. "Thank you for listening. The story is not over—it never is. Humanity’s journey continues, and so too does the hope for what might come next."

The hunter stepped out into the cool night air, the weight of the past heavy on his shoulders, yet the promise of tomorrow bright in his mind.
