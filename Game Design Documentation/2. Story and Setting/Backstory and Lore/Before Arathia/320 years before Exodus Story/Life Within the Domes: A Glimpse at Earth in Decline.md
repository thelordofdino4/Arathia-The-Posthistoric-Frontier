Life Within the Domes: A Glimpse at Earth in Decline320 Years Before Project Exodus

Prologue: A World Beyond Saving

By 320 years before Project Exodus, Earth’s biosphere was in its final collapse. Over 95% of all complex multicellular species had vanished, leaving the planet’s surface barren and broken. Humanity’s efforts to save what remained centered on isolated artificial biomes—domed refuges where the last flickers of Earth’s life clung to existence.

Within these hermetically sealed sanctuaries, the air was filtered, the water recycled, and the ecosystems carefully monitored. These domes were technological marvels, but they were also prisons—enclosing both the remnants of nature and the people who had devoted their lives to preserving it.

The Habitat Dome of New Eden

New Eden, located in the ruins of what had once been the Appalachian Mountains, was among the most advanced of these refuges. It housed a carefully curated collection of flora and fauna, from hardy grasses to endangered amphibians, all overseen by a team of biologists, engineers, and technicians.

Inside the dome, the artificial environment hummed with the subtle rhythms of controlled life. Sunlamps mimicked the day-night cycle, and irrigation systems maintained carefully calibrated moisture levels. It was a fragile balance, and every detail was monitored with unyielding precision.

Dr. Lila Marquez, a senior ecologist, walked the narrow paths of the central arboretum, clipboard in hand. The air smelled faintly of damp soil, a rarity in a world where the outside atmosphere had become toxic.

“Report from Sector Three,” she murmured into her headset. “Pollinator drones are underperforming. Run diagnostics and increase their range by 10%.”

Life for the Caretakers

For the 500 inhabitants of New Eden, life revolved around the dome’s rhythms. The human population was a mix of scientists, support staff, and their families. Most were born inside the dome and had never stepped foot outside. They lived in small, communal quarters built into the dome’s perimeter, where every resource was rationed and recycled.

Children attended lessons in multi-purpose classrooms, where they learned about the world that had been. Interactive holograms depicted extinct megafauna like elephants and whales, creatures the children would never see outside of archived footage.

“Why didn’t we save them?” a child asked during one lesson. The teacher, an older man with gray hair and weary eyes, paused before replying.

“We tried,” he said simply. “But we ran out of time.”

Meals consisted of hydroponically grown vegetables, lab-grown proteins, and algae-based supplements. Every bite was a testament to human ingenuity—and to the harsh reality of scarcity.

A Fragile Ecosystem

The dome’s ecosystem was a patchwork quilt of biomes stitched together in an attempt to mimic the diversity of the natural world. Small ponds housed frogs and insects, while carefully maintained plots grew grains and medicinal plants. But the balance was tenuous.

One evening, alarms blared in the dome’s control center. Dr. Marquez rushed in, her heart pounding.

“What happened?” she demanded.

“Sector Four’s filtration system failed,” a technician replied. “Carbon dioxide levels are rising.”

The team worked through the night, patching the system and rebalancing the oxygen levels. By morning, the crisis was averted, but the strain on the staff was palpable.

“We’re patching cracks in a dam that’s already broken,” Marquez confided to a colleague. “How much longer can we keep this up?”

The Outside World

Occasionally, maintenance crews ventured beyond the dome to retrieve supplies or repair external systems. They wore heavy, pressurized suits to shield themselves from the unbreathable air and the radiation-laden sunlight. These excursions were brief, and every return required extensive decontamination.

One such crew returned with a rare find: a cluster of wildflowers struggling to bloom in the cracked soil. Dr. Marquez examined them with awe.

“They’re adapting,” she whispered. “Against all odds, they’re finding a way.”

The flowers were brought into the dome and integrated into the arboretum. For the inhabitants of New Eden, it was a bittersweet moment. While the blooms symbolized resilience, their removal from the outside world meant the loss of an organism beginning to adapt to Earth’s harsh new reality. It was a reminder that even acts of preservation came with consequences, a fragile trade-off between survival and loss.

Epilogue: The Weight of Survival

Life within the domes was both a triumph and a tragedy. While they represented humanity’s ability to preserve and adapt, they also underscored the enormity of what had been lost. For Dr. Marquez and her colleagues, each day was a battle against entropy, a race to protect the last remnants of Earth’s once-vast biosphere.

As the sunlamps dimmed over New Eden and the inhabitants settled into their routines, the question lingered in everyone’s mind:

Was this preservation, or merely prolonging the inevitable?
