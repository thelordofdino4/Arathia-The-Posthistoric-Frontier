Life Beyond the Biodomes: Corporate-Controlled Habitats on a Dying Earth



320 Years Before Project Exodus



The wind outside the dome howled, carrying with it the toxic grit of Earth’s barren surface. Inside, the city pulsed with life, an artificial heartbeat sustaining the last remnants of humanity. Streets lined with towering residential blocks buzzed with the hum of commerce and the drone of hydroponic farms stacked high in the industrial zones. Neon lights cast a synthetic glow, disguising the underlying cracks in the system.



In one such dome, towering over what had once been the fertile plains of the Midwest, Samuel Kern trudged home through crowded walkways. He was a maintenance worker—a cog in the vast machinery that kept the dome’s life-support systems running. Every step he took echoed with the faint hum of air circulation units hidden in the walls, a constant reminder of their dependence on technology.



Samuel glanced at a massive holographic display mounted in the central plaza. It showed lush forests, rivers teeming with life, and children playing in green meadows. Below the images, bold letters proclaimed: "Together, We Thrive." Samuel’s lips twisted into a bitter smile. He’d never seen a tree outside a screen.



The Strata of Survival



Life within the dome was stratified—literally and figuratively. The higher levels housed the corporate elite in luxury apartments with private gardens and panoramic views of the artificial sky. Their air was fresher, their food richer, their lives more secure. Down below, in the cramped lower sectors, unskilled workers like Samuel scraped by on rationed meals and recycled air.



Tonight, Samuel’s dinner was a block of algae protein, its green hue unappetizing under the flickering lights of his apartment. He shared the space with three others, their cots stacked like shelves against the wall. Conversation was sparse; exhaustion had stolen their words.



Above them, in the elite quarters, Vanessa Marlowe, an executive with the dome’s governing corporation, sipped a glass of synthetic wine. Her floor-to-ceiling window displayed a curated view of the arboretum, its carefully arranged flora thriving under UV lamps. She barely noticed the beauty anymore. Her focus was on the report in her hands, detailing yet another protest in the lower sectors.



A World of Contradictions



For the dome’s inhabitants, emotions ran high. Some felt gratitude, even pride, in the dome’s achievements. After all, humanity had managed to carve out oases of life in a world that had turned hostile. Others, like Samuel, harbored quiet resentment.



On his rare days off, Samuel joined his friend Leena in one of the communal spaces. The room was sparse but functional, with benches and aging entertainment screens. Today, Leena was animated, her voice carrying above the hum of machinery.



“Did you hear?” she said, leaning closer. “Another group tried to breach the executive level last night. Security’s been doubled.”



Samuel snorted. “And? What did it accomplish?”



“It’s not about results,” Leena replied. “It’s about making them feel the pressure. They can’t ignore us forever.”



Samuel shook his head. “They’ve ignored us for decades. What makes you think that’ll change now?”



The Corporate Grip



Vanessa Marlowe attended an emergency meeting that evening. The room was filled with executives, their faces lit by the glow of a central display showing resource allocation graphs. The protest in the lower sectors was a minor blip compared to the real issue: diminishing resources.



“The hydroponic yields are down another 3%,” an agricultural director reported. “We’ll need to implement stricter rationing.”



“Rationing will only incite more unrest,” Vanessa countered. “We need to address the root cause: morale. Launch another media campaign. Highlight the advancements we’re making in Mars colonization. Give them hope.”



“Hope doesn’t grow crops,” another executive muttered.



A Moment of Reflection



Later that night, Samuel lay awake on his cot, staring at the cracked ceiling. Leena’s words echoed in his mind. He thought of the protests, the algae rations, the air filters that always seemed one power failure away from catastrophe. But he also thought of the children he saw in the communal spaces, laughing as they played virtual games. He thought of the few wildflowers preserved in the arboretum, their colors a defiant splash of beauty in an artificial world.



Above him, Vanessa stood by her window, gazing out at the arboretum. She thought of her family’s home, long buried under the shifting sands of what had once been a thriving coastal city. She thought of the numbers on the resource report, each one a reminder of the fragility of their survival. And she thought of the people in the lower sectors, whose faces she rarely saw but whose lives were inextricably linked to her own.



Epilogue: The Question of Survival



The domes were humanity’s lifeline, but they were also a stark reminder of its failures. For every innovation, there was a compromise; for every triumph, a sacrifice. As the days passed and the world outside grew ever more inhospitable, the people inside the domes continued to grapple with the same question:



Were they preserving humanity, or merely delaying its end?: Corporate-Controlled Habitats on a Dying Earth
