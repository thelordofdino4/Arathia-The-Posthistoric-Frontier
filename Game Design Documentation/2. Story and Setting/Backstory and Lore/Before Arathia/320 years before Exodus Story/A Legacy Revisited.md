A Legacy Revisited315 Years Before Project Exodus

Elias Cormack sat in the conservatory of his estate, a rare haven of green amidst Earth’s ravaged landscape. He leaned heavily on his cane, his body frail with age but his mind still sharp. The room was filled with the faint hum of ventilation systems, a reminder of the artificial life-support systems sustaining the plants around him. Across from him sat Vanessa Marlowe, her expression poised but curious, her hands folded neatly in her lap.

Elias studied her for a moment before breaking the silence. “You have her eyes, you know.”

Vanessa tilted her head, a faint smile appearing. “My mother? I’ve heard that before. I wish I remembered her better.”

Elias nodded. “Dr. Selene Marlowe was... remarkable. Headstrong, brilliant, and utterly relentless. She believed in the ERI with every fiber of her being. I’m glad you came. There’s much I want to discuss—about her, about the work she began, and the work I’ve carried forward.”

Selene’s Legacy

Elias leaned back in his chair, his gaze distant. “Selene’s vision for the Earth Reseeding Initiative was ahead of its time. She understood the stakes better than anyone else. When the ERI was shelved, it wasn’t just a professional loss for her—it was a personal tragedy. She fought so hard to keep it alive, even as the world turned its back.”

Vanessa nodded, her voice soft. “She’d talk about it sometimes—about how she felt she’d failed. But you worked with her, didn’t you? On Project Tyrannosaur?”

Elias chuckled lightly. “Yes, though we were on opposite sides of the ethical divide more often than not. Selene disapproved of the directions some of us took. She was wary of the risks. Project Tyrannosaur wasn’t just about reviving the past; it was about understanding resilience. I tried to use what we learned to help Terragene pivot towards sustainability—to give humanity a fighting chance.”

He gestured to the conservatory around them. “This, for example. The genetic breakthroughs we made with extinct flora and fauna allowed us to rebuild ecosystems, even on a small scale. I took Terragene in a new direction after Harlan’s... departure. We focused on preservation and rehabilitation, rather than exploitation. It wasn’t enough, not nearly enough, but it was something.”

The Future of the Stars

Vanessa leaned forward, intrigued. “You’ve done so much, Elias. But the world is still in decline. What’s next? What’s left?”

Elias’s eyes gleamed with a rare spark of excitement. “FTL travel,” he said simply. “We’re close, Vanessa. Closer than anyone realizes. The first successful unmanned test was thirty years ago, but the progress since has been painstakingly slow—deliberately so. The mega-corporations have been setting us back at every turn, fearful of losing control over a humanity spread across the stars. I’ve worked tirelessly behind the scenes to fight them, and now... now we’re on the verge of something big. What comes next will change everything.”

Vanessa’s breath caught. “You mean... interstellar colonization?”

Elias nodded. “Yes. The stars are our future, Vanessa. But we can’t repeat the mistakes we made here on Earth. That’s why I need you. Selene’s work is preserved in orbit around Earth, Mars, and the Belt, encrypted and waiting. It’s been lying dormant for decades, but the time to use it is near. I need someone I can trust to pick up where she left off. Someone who understands what’s at stake. If we’re to seed the stars with life, it must be done with care, with responsibility. I can’t do it alone, and I need to know if you’re ready to take this on after I’m gone.”

A Personal Plea

Vanessa’s expression shifted to one of hesitation. “You want me to revive her work? To finish what she started?”

Elias reached across the table, his frail hand covering hers. “I’m asking you to help humanity honor her vision. Selene saw a future where we didn’t just survive—we thrived. We can still achieve that, but only if we’re prepared. I can’t do this alone, Vanessa. I don’t have much time left.”

His voice grew softer. “I think of her often, you know. Selene. I think about how proud she’d be to see you now. You have her strength. Her determination. This is your chance to carry her torch.”

Vanessa swallowed hard, emotions flickering across her face. Finally, she nodded. “I’ll do it, Elias. I’ll help you get the project back up and running. We’ll ensure my mother’s work finally seeds the stars. But I’ll need your guidance.”

Elias smiled, a tired but genuine expression. “You have it. For as long as I’m here.”

A Shared Vision

As the conversation continued, the two of them outlined plans for the future. Vanessa would delve into her mother’s work, while Elias would ensure that Terragene’s resources were aligned with their efforts. It was a daunting task, but for the first time in years, Vanessa felt a sense of purpose—a connection to her mother’s legacy and a glimmer of hope for humanity’s future.

The stars awaited, and with them, the chance to begin anew.
