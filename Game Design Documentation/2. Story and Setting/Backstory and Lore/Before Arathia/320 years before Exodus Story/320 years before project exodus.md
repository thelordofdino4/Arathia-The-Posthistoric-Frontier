# 320 Years Before Project Exodus: The Sixth Mass Extinction  

---

## **A Catastrophic Collapse**  

By 320 years before Project Exodus, Earth had entered the terminal stages of the Sixth Mass Extinction. Over 75% of all complex multicellular species had vanished, leaving the planet’s ecosystems shattered beyond recognition. What had once been a thriving biosphere teeming with life was now a bleak, inhospitable wasteland.  

While isolated populations of flora and fauna survived in artificial biomes and refuges, these efforts were too limited to restore the intricate balance of Earth’s ecosystems. The damage was irreversible, cementing Earth’s status as a dying world.

## **The Causes of the Sixth Mass Extinction**  

### **Climate Change and Environmental Degradation**  
Decades of unregulated industrial activity and ecological mismanagement accelerated the planet’s collapse:  
- **Rising Temperatures**: Global warming caused average temperatures to increase by 4–6°C, triggering catastrophic weather events and destroying habitats.  
- **Ocean Acidification**: Increased CO2 absorption by oceans led to widespread coral bleaching, the collapse of marine food chains, and the extinction of countless aquatic species.  
- **Deforestation**: The relentless clearing of forests for agriculture and urban expansion destroyed habitats and contributed to the loss of biodiversity.  

### **Pollution and Contamination**  
Human activity poisoned the planet, further accelerating species loss:  
- **Chemical Pollution**: Pesticides, industrial runoff, and heavy metals contaminated soil and water, killing plant and animal life.  
- **Microplastics**: Oceans became choked with plastic waste, devastating marine ecosystems.  
- **Nuclear Fallout**: Conflict and accidents involving nuclear weapons and reactors rendered entire regions uninhabitable.  

### **Overexploitation of Resources**  
Unchecked resource extraction pushed many species to the brink:  
- **Overfishing**: Global fish populations collapsed as humans harvested marine life faster than it could reproduce.  
- **Hunting and Poaching**: Iconic species like elephants, tigers, and rhinos were driven to extinction by overhunting and habitat loss.  
- **Agricultural Monocultures**: Industrial farming practices replaced biodiverse ecosystems with single-crop landscapes, reducing genetic diversity and increasing vulnerability to disease.

## **The Scope of Extinction**  

### **Terrestrial Species**  
- **Mammals**: Large herbivores and predators, such as elephants, lions, and wolves, were among the first to disappear due to habitat loss and human activity.  
- **Birds**: Over 80% of bird species went extinct as forests vanished and pollution contaminated their food sources.  
- **Insects**: Pollinator populations, critical to food production, were decimated by pesticide use and climate change, further destabilizing ecosystems.  

### **Marine Species**  
- **Coral Reefs**: Once vibrant ecosystems teeming with life, coral reefs were reduced to barren skeletons due to warming seas and acidification.  
- **Fish and Marine Mammals**: Entire populations of fish, whales, and dolphins vanished as overfishing and pollution wiped out their habitats.  
- **Plankton**: The foundation of the oceanic food chain was severely affected, leading to cascading extinctions across marine ecosystems.  

### **Plants and Fungi**  
- **Forests**: Rainforests and temperate forests were almost entirely destroyed, replaced by deserts and barren lands.  
- **Agricultural Crops**: Non-resilient monocultures suffered from pests and climate extremes, further reducing biodiversity.  
- **Fungal Networks**: The underground fungal networks that supported plant life were disrupted, further damaging soil fertility and vegetation.

## **Survivors in Artificial Biomes**  

### **Human-Created Refuges**  
Efforts to preserve Earth’s remaining biodiversity led to the creation of artificial biomes:  
- **Biosphere Reserves**: Massive enclosed ecosystems housed a fraction of surviving species, carefully monitored and maintained by humans.  
- **Seed Vaults**: Facilities like the Global Seed Vault stored millions of plant species for future restoration attempts.  
- **Genetic Archives**: Advanced cryogenic storage and digital genome databases preserved the genetic material of extinct species for potential revival.  

### **Isolated Ecosystems**  
In rare cases, natural refuges allowed small populations of species to persist:  
- **Deep Ocean Zones**: Some marine life survived in remote, deep-sea environments beyond human reach.  
- **Mountainous Regions**: Isolated high-altitude areas offered shelter for a handful of resilient species.  
- **Underground Habitats**: Certain species adapted to life in subterranean environments, shielded from the planet’s surface chaos.

## **Human Response to the Extinction**  

### **Desperation and Guilt**  
Humanity’s role in the extinction crisis was undeniable, sparking widespread despair and introspection:  
- **Ecological Grief**: Entire generations mourned the loss of Earth’s natural beauty and biodiversity.  
- **Cultural Collapse**: The extinction of so many species eroded cultural identities and traditions tied to the natural world.  
- **Blame and Division**: Governments, corporations, and individuals blamed one another for failing to prevent the crisis, deepening societal fractures.  

### **Technological Stopgaps**  
As natural ecosystems collapsed, humanity relied on technology to fill the void:  
- **Synthetic Ecosystems**: Artificial food production and water purification systems replaced natural processes.  
- **Terraforming Research**: Early studies explored how technology might one day restore Earth’s biosphere—or terraform other planets.  
- **Bioengineering**: Efforts to create resilient, genetically modified organisms provided short-term solutions but could not replace lost ecosystems.

## **Irreversible Damage**  

### **Planetary Collapse**  
By this time, Earth’s ecosystems were beyond saving:  
- **Feedback Loops**: The loss of biodiversity triggered cascading effects, accelerating desertification, deforestation, and ocean collapse.  
- **Uninhabitable Zones**: Over 70% of the planet’s surface was deemed uninhabitable due to extreme weather, pollution, and resource depletion.  
- **Loss of Ecosystem Services**: Essential processes like pollination, carbon sequestration, and nutrient cycling ceased, leaving humanity to rely entirely on artificial substitutes.  

### **A Warning for the Future**  
The Sixth Mass Extinction served as a grim reminder of humanity’s impact on the planet:  
- **Failure of Stewardship**: The extinction crisis highlighted humanity’s inability to balance technological progress with ecological responsibility.  
- **Lessons for Colonization**: The mistakes made on Earth informed future efforts to sustainably manage extraterrestrial ecosystems.

## **Conclusion**  

The Sixth Mass Extinction was a defining moment in Earth’s history—a period of profound loss that reshaped humanity’s relationship with the natural world. While a handful of species and genetic archives survived, the ecosystems that had sustained life for billions of years were gone. This era underscored the urgency of humanity’s search for a new home, as Earth could no longer provide one.
