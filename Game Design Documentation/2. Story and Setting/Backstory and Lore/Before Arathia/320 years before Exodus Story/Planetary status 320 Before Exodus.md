Earth: A Planet Beyond Recovery
320 Years Before Project Exodus

By this time, Earth was entrenched in the Sixth Mass Extinction, with over 75% of complex species wiped out. The biosphere had collapsed beyond natural recovery, leaving only fragments of life preserved in artificial systems. Humanity grappled with the irreversible consequences of environmental neglect, even as it sought refuge in technology and the stars.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 800 million, concentrated in fortified enclaves and urban remnants.

Presence of Liquid Water: Severely strained; over 70% of freshwater sources contaminated or depleted.

Chemical Environment: Oceans acidified; widespread soil and water contamination from industrial runoff.

Energy Sources: Predominantly nuclear and renewables; fossil fuels phased out but remnants persist in lawless zones.

Physical Conditions: Extreme weather, desertification, and flooding make over 70% of Earth's surface uninhabitable.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 19.2%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.11% (accelerating climate instability)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Nonexistent; hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires ravage the remaining habitable zones.

Radiation Protection: Ozone layer critically damaged; high UV levels threaten outdoor activities in equatorial regions.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, though mining and deforestation increase risks of localized subsidence and erosion.

Ecosystem Support: Fewer than 25% of species remain; ecosystems exist only in artificial biomes and isolated refuges.

Economic Indicators: Global economic systems collapse; mega-corporations focus on interstellar projects.

Military Capabilities: Disparate factions wield advanced weaponry to control resources and protect enclaves.

Geographical Factors: Coastal and arid regions abandoned; life consolidates in temperate zones and underground facilities.

Demographics: Aging, with low birth rates; populations splinter into isolated communities.

Technological Development: Advanced in bioengineering and synthetic ecosystems; breakthroughs focus on off-world sustainability.

International Relations: Largely dissolved; corporate governance replaces traditional state systems.

Environmental Considerations: Focus shifts entirely to preservation of genetic material and artificial ecosystems.

Magnetic Field: Stable but irrelevant to the collapse of the biosphere.

Geological Activity: Minimal tectonic activity; human-induced risks remain a concern.

Mars: A Fragile Ascent
320 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars continues to support a population of 6 million, reaching beyond its previous limits through technological innovation. However, the planet’s fragile infrastructure and reliance on external resources create persistent challenges.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 6 million, with steady but unsustainable growth.

Presence of Liquid Water: Carefully managed subsurface aquifers and ice mining sustain limited supply.

Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated atmosphere; breathable air confined to domes and underground habitats.

Energy Sources: Solar arrays, nuclear reactors, and emerging fusion technology support expanded settlements.

Physical Conditions: Habitable zones remain confined to domes and underground facilities.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; limited terraforming progress fails to expand habitable zones.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground habitats provide effective shielding.

Geophysical Stability: Stable but dust storms persist, disrupting infrastructure.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farms and controlled biomes provide food and air; imports from the Belt remain critical.

Economic Indicators: Economy stabilizes with increased independence from Earth and reliance on the Belt.

Military Capabilities: Small but advanced; focuses on protecting resources and enforcing internal security.

Geographical Factors: Expansion prioritizes water-rich regions near the poles.

Demographics: Skilled workforce with growing Martian-born population; societal stratification deepens.

Technological Development: Advances in resource management and synthetic ecosystems sustain the colony.

International Relations: Growing tension with Belt interests over resource allocation.

Environmental Considerations: Limited sustainability efforts focus on maintaining current infrastructure.

Magnetic Field: Absent; radiation mitigation remains critical.

Geological Activity: Minimal but monitored to avoid construction risks.

The Belt: Humanity’s Engine
320 Years Before Project Exodus

The Belt’s population exceeds 10 million, as it becomes the dominant supplier of resources for Earth and Mars. While conditions improve with technological advancements, social tensions rise as Belters push for autonomy.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 10 million, with increasing numbers of permanent settlers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable supply from ice mining; surplus supports off-world trade.

Chemical Environment: Controlled within habitats; Earth-like atmospheric conditions prevail.

Energy Sources: Solar power dominates; fusion technology adopted in high-demand areas.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity challenges mitigated by medical and biomechanical advancements.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially regulated; habitats sustain stable conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety from cosmic and solar radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Mining operations optimized to minimize structural risks.

Ecosystem Support: Expanding hydroponics reduce reliance on imports from Earth and Mars.

Economic Indicators: Thriving; resource exports dominate interplanetary trade.

Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces grow in sophistication, rivaling traditional armies.

Geographical Factors: Expansion focuses on resource-rich asteroids like Ceres, Vesta, and Psyche.

Demographics: Young and diverse population, with a growing sense of cultural identity.

Technological Development: Leading in resource extraction, habitat design, and transport logistics.

International Relations: Increasing autonomy challenges Earth’s influence; alliances with Mars grow.

Environmental Considerations: Operations balance efficiency with minimal ecological impact.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding fully integrated into habitats.

Geological Activity: Carefully managed to prevent accidents and resource loss.
