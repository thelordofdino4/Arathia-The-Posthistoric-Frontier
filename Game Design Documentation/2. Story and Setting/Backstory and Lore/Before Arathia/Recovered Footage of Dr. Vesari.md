### **Opening Scene**  
*(The footage begins in a dimly lit laboratory. Dr. Vesari is pacing angrily, gesturing at a tablet displaying financial records and project reports. Victor Harlan stands casually by a workstation, his expression cold and indifferent.)*

**Dr. Vesari:**  
"Do you think I don’t see what’s happening, Victor? Do you think I’m blind? You’re not funding the ERI out of some benevolent desire to save the world. You’re lining your pockets with contracts, patents, and kickbacks while the planet falls apart!"  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(Smirking)* "Now, Eleanor, let’s not get melodramatic. This is business. Someone has to pay the bills, and TerraGene has kept this operation afloat. Without us, you wouldn’t have your precious labs or your genetic archives."  

**Dr. Vesari:**  
"At what cost? Every dollar you ‘invest’ comes with strings. Strings that divert resources away from the ERI’s core mission and into pet projects that benefit *you*. You’re building bioweapons, Victor. You’re using our technology to patent genetic modifications and exploit them for corporate gain!"

### **Rising Tension**  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(Leaning against the desk, his tone condescending)* "And what exactly do you plan to do about it, Eleanor? You think your moral indignation means anything in the grand scheme of things? Let me remind you, ERI exists because of TerraGene and companies like it. Without us, it’s just a pipe dream."  

**Dr. Vesari:**  
*(Her voice rising)* "You’re killing any chance this planet has of recovering! You’re turning the ERI into a smokescreen for profiteering. The public still believes in this project, but I see the truth. Every day we’re losing species we could have saved because you siphon funds and resources for your own ends."  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(His smirk fades, replaced by a cold glare)* "Careful, Eleanor. You’re treading on dangerous ground. You’re not indispensable, no matter how important you think you are."

### **The Threats Escalate**  

**Dr. Vesari:**  
*(Stepping closer, her voice low and intense)* "You think I’m afraid of you, Victor? I’ve worked too hard, sacrificed too much, to let you destroy everything we’ve built. If you don’t stop—if you don’t *return* the funds you’ve stolen—I’ll take this public. I’ll release the proof of what you’re doing to the media, to the scientific community, to anyone who will listen."  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(Smirking again)* "And you think that will stop me? Eleanor, you’re naive if you think the world cares anymore. They’re too busy fighting over scraps to pay attention to your whistleblowing. Besides, what proof? You have nothing."  

**Dr. Vesari:**  
*(Pulling out a data drive and holding it up)* "Oh, I have plenty. Financial records, communications, even your connection to the deep state. You’re not just sabotaging the ERI—you’re profiting from the planet’s collapse. If this gets out, you won’t just lose your position. You’ll lose everything."

### **Harlan’s Response**  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(His tone darkens, his smirk replaced with icy resolve)* "You really don’t know who you’re dealing with, do you? You think waving around some data drive scares me? People like me don’t fall because of threats. People like you disappear when you push too far."  

**Dr. Vesari:**  
*(Unfazed, stepping even closer)* "Try me. If I go down, I’ll make sure you go down with me. This data is already backed up—secure, untouchable. Take your best shot, Victor, because I’m not going to let you destroy the last hope this planet has."  

---

### **The Disappearance**  

*(The footage cuts abruptly, static filling the screen for several seconds. When it resumes, the laboratory is empty. Dr. Vesari is nowhere to be seen. The data drive she held earlier lies on the floor, shattered.)*

## **Aftermath**  

- **Dr. Vesari’s Disappearance**: Officially reported as an "unfortunate accident," Dr. Vesari’s death was never fully investigated. Her body was never recovered, and the incident was quietly buried by ERI leadership.  
- **Harlan’s Influence**: Victor Harlan continued to rise in power, consolidating his control over ERI and its resources. The project’s focus shifted further toward corporate interests, alienating its original purpose.  
- **The Lost Data**: Despite Dr. Vesari’s claim of backups, no evidence of Harlan’s corruption surfaced. Whether the data existed or was erased remains unknown.

## **Legacy of Dr. Vesari**  

Dr. Eleanor Vesari’s passion and determination became a symbol of the ERI’s early ideals. Though her disappearance was shrouded in mystery, whispers of her defiance inspired a small but dedicated faction within the scientific community to push back against corporate exploitation. Her name remained a quiet reminder of the sacrifices made in humanity’s desperate bid to save its planet.
