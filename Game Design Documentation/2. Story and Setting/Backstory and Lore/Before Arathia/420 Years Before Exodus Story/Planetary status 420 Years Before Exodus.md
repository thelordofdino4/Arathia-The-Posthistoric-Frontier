Earth: A Struggling Cradle

420 Years Before Project Exodus

At this time, Earth’s biosphere remains diverse compared to its eventual state but continues to face significant declines. While 65% of species persist, habitat destruction, pollution, and industrial exploitation place them under immense strain. The rise of mega-corporations exacerbates inequality and environmental neglect, as they prioritize space-based resource extraction over planetary recovery.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 9.5 billion, concentrated in dense urban centers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Diminishing due to pollution and overuse; desalination plants supplement fresh water supplies.

Chemical Environment: Significant contamination of air, water, and soil; oceans show increasing acidification.

Energy Sources: Fossil fuels dominate, supplemented by nuclear and limited renewable sources.

Physical Conditions: Deteriorating; rising global temperatures and extreme weather events are common.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 20%

Carbon Dioxide: 0.06% (elevated levels contributing to climate instability)

Nitrogen: 78%

Climate Stability: Rapidly declining; severe storms, prolonged droughts, and heatwaves are frequent.

Radiation Protection: Ozone layer intact but increasingly strained by industrial emissions.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, though deforestation and urbanization exacerbate local risks.

Ecosystem Support: Shrinking; approximately 49% of Earth’s species remain.

Economic Indicators: GDP growth slowing; wealth disparity increasing.

Military Capabilities: National militaries remain strong, operating independently and with significant resources, but corporate influence over logistics and strategy is growing.

Geographical Factors: Urban sprawl dominates; rural areas increasingly abandoned or industrialized.

Demographics: Shrinking slowing; urban migration intensifies inequality and resource competition.

Technological Development: Advanced in computing, AI, and early space exploration, but constrained by corporate monopolization.

International Relations: Tensions rise over control of Belt resources; national governments weakened by corporate influence.

Environmental Considerations: Ecosystem preservation largely ignored in favor of short-term economic gain.

Magnetic Field: Stable and protective.

Geological Activity: Normal, with localized risks exacerbated by mining and deforestation.

Mars: The Emerging Frontier

420 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars continues its expansion as humanity’s interplanetary frontier. Domed habitats are increasing in number, and early terraforming experiments show limited but promising progress. The colony remains dependent on Earth and the Asteroid Belt for survival, but its growth inspires hope for a sustainable future.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 100,000, mostly skilled workers and scientists.

Presence of Liquid Water: Subsurface ice extraction remains primary; limited success in creating small aquifers.

Chemical Environment: Predominantly CO2 atmosphere; unbreathable without domed environments.

Energy Sources: Solar and nuclear reactors meet the needs of expanding habitats.

Physical Conditions: Harsh and unyielding; outdoor activity requires full life-support systems.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%

Nitrogen: 79%

Climate Stability: Artificially controlled within domes; terraforming efforts show limited progress.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground facilities provide necessary shielding.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; dust storms pose regular challenges.

Ecosystem Support: Limited to hydroponic farms and controlled biomes; genetically modified crops show promise.

Economic Indicators: Dependent on Earth and Belt imports; fledgling local manufacturing.

Military Capabilities: Minimal; security focuses on internal stability and resource protection.

Geographical Factors: Expansion concentrated around Valles Marineris and resource-rich regions.

Demographics: Predominantly young, skilled professionals with technical expertise.

Technological Development: Advanced in terraforming and life-support systems, but limited by resource constraints.

International Relations: Reliant on Earth and the Belt for trade; tensions over resource allocation growing.

Environmental Considerations: Early sustainability efforts focus on minimizing habitat degradation.

Magnetic Field: Lacking; artificial shielding compensates for radiation exposure.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring safety for construction.

The Belt: Humanity’s Lifeline

420 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt emerges as a critical industrial and economic hub. Early mining stations, such as those on Ceres and Vesta, provide essential resources for Earth and Mars. Life in the Belt is harsh, but technological advancements and economic opportunities attract a growing population of pioneers.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 100,000, consisting of miners, engineers, and support staff.

Presence of Liquid Water: Derived from ice mining; critical for life support and fuel production.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated within habitats; Earth-like atmospheric conditions maintained.

Energy Sources: Solar power dominates; experimental fusion reactors supplement energy needs.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity necessitates rigorous health protocols.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%

Nitrogen: 79%

Climate Stability: Controlled within habitats; consistent and regulated conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding protects workers from cosmic and solar radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining operations carefully monitored to prevent accidents.

Ecosystem Support: Limited to hydroponics; food imported from Earth and Mars.

Economic Indicators: Rapid growth driven by resource extraction; wealth concentrated among corporate entities.

Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces maintain order and protect operations.

Geographical Factors: Stations scattered across resource-rich asteroids.

Demographics: Predominantly male workforce with high turnover rates.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge in mining, life support, and logistics; critical for sustaining Mars and Earth.

International Relations: Tensions rising as Belters demand autonomy from Earth’s corporations.

Environmental Considerations: Minimal; operations carefully managed to avoid catastrophic failures.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety within habitats.

Geological Activity: Carefully monitored to avoid risks during mining.
