Race in the Shadows (Circa 420 YBE)

The lights flickered in the hidden corridor deep beneath New Zurich Station—one of the few places on Earth still receiving intermittent power. Drones patrolled the perimeter, scanning for intruders, while a handful of armed sentries guarded each sealed bulkhead. Within this labyrinth of steel and concrete, some of humanity’s most brilliant minds were locked in a quiet arms race.

Rise of Covert Factions

At the far end of a narrow chamber, Cora Allais, director of the Corvax Foundation, studied a holographic starchart shimmering over the round conference table. “What you’re looking at,” she said to her assembled advisors, “is the path we’ll take to outmaneuver the HeliosCorp labs in the Gobi. Our facility in the Alps detected their warp experiments three days ago—they’re dangerously close to stabilizing a subluminal–warp hybrid engine.”

A hush fell across the room. The Corvax Foundation was just one of many powerful entities vying for control of experimental FTL research. From the ravaged cityscapes of North America to the withering farmland of Eastern Europe, entire nations had crumbled under famine, pandemics, and rolling blackouts. In their place rose hidden enclaves funded by shadowy mega-corporations, each convinced that harnessing faster-than-light technology was the only hope for long-term survival—and dominion.

Reports trickled in of sabotage across the globe: labs in Siberia bombed by unknown forces, a rumored facility beneath the Australian Outback suffering a mysterious meltdown. Rival factions launched strikes to cripple each other’s progress, ironically slowing humanity’s overall push toward FTL yet stoking the relentless competition. In these final days of Earth’s great unraveling, secrecy and cunning proved as vital as science.

Mars Test Flights

Midway through Cora’s briefing, an encrypted message scrolled across the holo-screen: Mars Colonial Initiative Launch Successful—Engines Performed Above Specs. A murmur rippled through the group. News from Mars—once heralded as a beacon of hope—had become intermittent. The colony there, struggling to grow enough food and maintain stable biospheres, found itself forced into the same desperate race that plagued Earth. For months, it had offered to act as a testbed for new propulsion prototypes, boasting minimal atmospheric drag and abundant solar power.

In orbit around the Red Planet, tiny warp experiment modules were launched from makeshift platforms near Phobos. Each test aimed to manipulate local spacetime, if only by millimeters. Engineers believed that if they could refine these partial warp fields, they might drastically shorten the Earth–Mars travel window from months to mere days. The latest reports were encouraging: advanced subluminal engines cut the standard transit time by half, sparking rumors of unstoppable progress.

But progress was costly. On Mars, accidents with half-baked warp bubbles had shredded two test craft, while resource shortages on the surface drove colonists to protest. They demanded safer, more immediate solutions to the red planet’s existential woes. Meanwhile, looming overhead were the unstoppable cogs of corporate agendas—loyal to profits and survival rather than Mars’s aspirations of independence.

Breakdown of Earthly Governance

Yet to most people on Earth—burdened by near-constant power outages and dwindling food supplies—the emerging FTL arms race felt like a fantastical rumor. A few local radio stations crackled with talk of “time-bending labs” or “miracle engines in orbit,” but such claims were often dismissed as hoaxes.

 No central authority existed to regulate experimental labs or unify efforts at relief. War-torn highways and ghost cities spoke to the scale of systemic failure. Militia warlords carved up countries, ruling through fear and the promise of scarce resources. In this patchwork of devastation, covert factions like Corvax, Helios Corp, and others wielded near-limitless power—hiding advanced technology beneath the radar while everyday citizens starved or fled.

In a small observation alcove overlooking the base’s subterranean launch silo, Cora Allais huddled with her chief engineer, Dr. Basilio Lansing. Their voices were low and urgent, the overhead lights casting sharp shadows on their tired faces.

“They say HeliosCorp has a warp-skip prototype nearly ready for demonstration,” Lansing said, flipping through a set of digital readouts. “If they succeed, they’ll monopolize the entire FTL corridor—Earth, Mars, maybe beyond.”

Cora’s mouth tightened. “We can’t allow that. Humanity needs more than a corporate monopoly on the stars. We may not have full warp capability yet, but we have to keep pace or surpass them. Our latest engine designs are weeks from a possible test, but sabotage from rivals—or even our own fracturing alliances—could cripple us.”

A siren suddenly wailed through the corridors. An intruder alert. Cora shot Lansing a meaningful look, and both ran for the secure lab. Over the intercom, one of the guards reported a breach in the lower levels. Static cut short the call, leaving them with only the echo of conflict in the halls. It seemed another faction had found them—or perhaps a rogue group within their own ranks wanted the warp data for itself.

A World Fraying, A Race Undeterred

Cora’s heart hammered. She and Lansing both knew that beneath all the clandestine plots, Earth’s environment was still decaying at an accelerating rate. Crops perished to swirling dust storms, and entire populations collapsed into famine. That desperation fanned the flames of covert research, for if Earth was doomed, whoever seized FTL first might lead a renewed exodus.

In the dim glow of the station’s emergency lights, the doctor and the director sprinted through half-lit corridors. They could hear gunfire somewhere in the maze of passageways—a testament to how far Earth had fallen. And yet, no bullets or sabotage could dampen the fervor driving each hidden lab, each corporate citadel, and each Mars-bound outpost. FTL was the grail, the last shot at preserving human civilization—if only a chosen few.

The last thing Cora saw before rounding a corner was a console monitor showing a Mars Colonial Initiative feed. The subluminal engine test had succeeded again; flight times to Mars had plummeted. A single sentence scrolled at the bottom: “Warp experimentation to intensify—approval for full-scale modules.”

Despite the chaos enveloping her, a flicker of determination lit Cora’s eyes. She pressed on, certain that in the depths of this covert arms race lay humanity’s only route to survival—even as the world fractured beneath them.
