Piracy Above the Earth: Leyton Vance and the Space Elevator420 Years Before Project Exodus

Setting the Scene

The vast expanse of Earth’s orbit had become a chaotic battleground for resources. By 420 years before Project Exodus, Earth’s dwindling reserves and fractured global politics had given rise to a new breed of criminals: space pirates. Their targets weren’t gold or electronics but water—the lifeblood of survival in space.

One such hotspot for piracy was the United States’ space elevator, a marvel of 22nd-century engineering. Stretching from the Texas plains to geostationary orbit, it had become a vital artery for moving goods and personnel to the stars. It was also a beacon for opportunists.

Leyton Vance on Patrol

The interior of the orbital station tethered to the elevator was all cold metal and flickering panels. Leyton Vance, a young security operative with a sharp mind and a growing reputation, adjusted the visor of his helmet as he surveyed the incoming cargo vessels.

“How many today?” he asked, his voice steady despite the tension in the room.

“Six verified transports,” replied Private Darnell, a fellow operative monitoring the docking procedures. “Two flagged as suspicious. Mostly water haulers from the Belt.”

Leyton frowned. Water theft had become a grim reality. Pirates hijacked ice shipments from the asteroid belt and sold them on the black market. Each stolen shipment was a blow to Mars, Earth’s orbital stations, and the Belt’s fragile economy.

“I don’t get it,” Leyton muttered, leaning over the monitor. “Water of all things. We have the tech to pull it from asteroids and recycle almost every drop. And yet…”

“And yet people still find a way to mess it all up,” Darnell finished. “Some things never change.”

An alarm blared, snapping them to attention. A vessel approaching Dock 3 had veered off its designated path.

“ID that ship,” Leyton ordered, pulling on his gloves.

“Freighter ‘Calypso,’ flagged three times for irregular flight patterns,” Darnell replied. “It’s supposed to be carrying processed water ice from Ceres.”

“Patch me through to the pilot,” Leyton said, striding toward the airlock.

The Confrontation

“Calypso, this is Security Officer Vance aboard Orbital Station Alpha,” Leyton’s voice crackled through the comms. “You’re off course. State your intentions.”

For a moment, there was only static. Then a garbled voice replied.

“Minor systems failure. Adjusting now. No need for alarm.”

Leyton exchanged a look with Darnell.

“Systems failure? Convenient,” Darnell muttered. “Want to bet they’re running cold cargo?”

Leyton activated the station’s scanners, focusing on the freighter. The results were damning: thermal readings showed several compartments running colder than expected. Contraband water ice.

“Calypso, prepare for inspection,” Leyton commanded. “Failure to comply will be treated as an act of aggression.”

The ship did not slow. Instead, its engines flared, pushing it toward the elevator’s docking arm. Leyton cursed.

“They’re making a run for it. Darnell, scramble interceptors.”

Moments later, two sleek drones launched from the station, cutting through the void with practiced efficiency. They flanked the Calypso, their weapons systems armed but not yet deployed. Leyton watched the chase unfold on the monitor, his jaw tight.

“Don’t make me do this,” he muttered.

The Calypso’s pilot, desperate, attempted an erratic maneuver to shake the drones. It was a fatal mistake. One of the interceptors fired a warning shot, clipping the ship’s rear engine. The freighter spun out of control, tumbling toward the planet below.

Aftermath

Rescue teams recovered the remains of the Calypso’s crew hours later. The contraband water ice had been melted in the descent, leaving little evidence beyond the ship’s manifest and Leyton’s report.

In the station’s debriefing room, Leyton sat across from his commanding officer, Captain Irene Park. Her expression was unreadable as she reviewed the footage.

“You handled it by the book,” she said at last.

“Did I?” Leyton replied, his tone bitter. “We stopped a theft. But at what cost? A ship destroyed, lives lost. All for a few tons of ice.”

Park leaned forward. “That ice could have sustained thousands. The Belt’s entire economy relies on trust—on the integrity of these shipments. If pirates think they can get away with it, it’ll only get worse.”

Leyton nodded but remained unconvinced. The weight of the day’s events lingered as he left the room, staring out a viewport at the Earth below. Its surface was scarred and broken, a stark reminder of why humanity had turned to the stars in the first place.

Reflections

Later, in the station’s quiet observation deck, Leyton spoke softly to himself.

“We’re fighting over water,” he murmured. “Water. The one thing Earth had in abundance. And now, we’re killing each other for it in orbit.”

Behind him, the lights of the station flickered as if echoing his unease. The Belt, Mars, Earth—all were struggling to survive. And Leyton Vance, not yet an admiral, could feel the fragile threads holding humanity together starting to fray.
