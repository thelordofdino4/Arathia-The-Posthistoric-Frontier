380 Years Before Project Exodus: News Report on the Mars Crisis and Victor Harlan’s Final Interview

Transcript of GNN Broadcast

Broadcast Origin: Global News Network (GNN) Headquarters, EarthDate: 380 Years Before Project ExodusSegment Title: Mars in Crisis: Humanity’s Fragile Frontier

(The broadcast opens with dramatic music and a sweeping montage of Mars’ terraformed domes, the crumbling infrastructure of Earth, and bustling asteroid belt stations. The camera cuts to anchorwoman Clara Deyn seated at a sleek news desk.)

Opening Segment

Clara Deyn (Anchor):"Good evening, viewers. Tonight, we delve into the mounting crisis on Mars, where the planet’s population has reached its breaking point. Once humanity’s symbol of hope and expansion, Mars now stands on the brink of collapse. The implications for Earth and the asteroid belt are dire, as Mars’ troubles ripple across the solar system."

The Situation on Mars

(Footage of Mars’ colonies appears on screen—domed cities surrounded by barren landscapes, overcrowded streets, and resource distribution centers with long lines of frustrated colonists.)

Deyn:"Over the last century, Mars has struggled to sustain its growing population. While terraforming efforts have increased habitable areas to nearly five percent of the planet, these advancements have not kept pace with demand. The colony is now plagued by food shortages, water scarcity, and mounting unrest among its residents.

Our Mars correspondent, Aaron Trevyn, reports from Olympus City."

(The camera cuts to Aaron Trevyn standing in a crowded square beneath the glass dome of Olympus City. The area is filled with colonists holding signs demanding better living conditions.)

Aaron Trevyn (Correspondent):"Thank you, Clara. The mood here is tense as Mars’ residents voice their frustration with the colony’s leadership and the corporations overseeing resource distribution. Many here feel abandoned, both by Earth’s governing bodies and by the Belt’s mining conglomerates. Let’s hear what some of the colonists have to say."

(Trevyn turns to a middle-aged colonist, her face weathered but determined.)

Colonist #1:"We came here for a better life, but it’s a nightmare. We’re packed into overcrowded habitats, rationing water and food. They promised us Mars would be the future, but all we see is more suffering."

(The camera shifts to a younger man, holding a sign reading ‘Mars Deserves Better.’)

Colonist #2:"Mars isn’t a colony anymore—we’re a planet of our own. But Earth and the Belt treat us like second-class citizens. We need autonomy, not handouts."

(The footage cuts back to Trevyn.)

Trevyn:"Protests like this are becoming more common across Mars. Without immediate intervention, the situation is poised to escalate further."

(The broadcast cuts back to Clara Deyn at the desk.)

Opinions from Earth and the Belt

Deyn:"The Mars crisis is a polarizing issue, drawing sharp reactions from people across Earth and the Belt. Many on Earth see Mars as a failed experiment."

(The screen shows interviews with people in Earth’s urban centers, their surroundings marked by environmental decay.)

Earth Resident #1:"Why should we care about Mars when we can’t even fix Earth? They’ve got domes and terraforming—we’ve got toxic air and dying ecosystems."

Earth Resident #2:"They chose to leave. Let them deal with their own mess. Earth’s problems come first."

(The footage shifts to a mining station in the Belt, where workers are interviewed.)

Belt Worker #1:"Mars always wants more—more resources, more support. Meanwhile, we’re the ones risking our lives mining for the stuff they need. Maybe if they managed their population better, we wouldn’t be in this mess."

Belt Worker #2:"We’re tired of carrying Mars and Earth on our backs. If they want help, they better start treating us like equals."

Victor Harlan’s Final Interview

Deyn:"Amid the growing crisis, TerraGene Industries has come under fire for its handling of resource distribution and its role in Mars’ escalating problems. Two days ago, we spoke with Victor Harlan, CEO of TerraGene, about these accusations. Here is an excerpt from that interview."

(The footage cuts to Victor Harlan, seated in a sleek office with a holographic projection of Mars behind him. He exudes confidence, his tone measured and dismissive.)

Victor Harlan:"Mars is not collapsing—it’s evolving. Growing pains are natural for a colony of this size, especially one as ambitious as Mars. TerraGene has been at the forefront of supporting Mars’ development, providing essential resources and technological innovations.

The truth is, many of these so-called ‘crises’ are exaggerated by opportunistic voices looking to undermine our efforts. We’re not perfect, but no one else has done as much for Mars as TerraGene."

(The interviewer, unseen in the clip, asks about accusations of profiteering and resource hoarding.)

Interviewer:"Mr. Harlan, records show TerraGene didn’t even rank in the top 10% of corporate donors providing aid to Mars last quarter. Organizations like Horizon Dynamics and SolPact have consistently outpaced TerraGene, funding critical water reclamation projects and habitat expansion initiatives. How do you reconcile that with your claim that TerraGene has been at the forefront of supporting Mars’ development?"

Harlan:(Smiling coldly, visibly stiffening)"We’re working on large-scale projects that require long-term investment. It’s easy for smaller collectives to take the spotlight with one-off contributions, but TerraGene is building Mars’ future, not chasing headlines."

(The footage ends, cutting back to Deyn.)

Closing Remarks

Deyn:"Victor Harlan’s comments have sparked heated debate, with many accusing him of deflecting responsibility. His words may not have been enough to reassure Mars’ colonists or his critics on Earth and the Belt.

As the Mars crisis deepens, the stakes for humanity’s survival grow ever higher. Will we find a way to bridge the divide between our scattered worlds, or will we fracture further under the weight of our challenges? Only time will tell. Thank you for joining us tonight on GNN. Goodnight."

(The broadcast ends with the GNN logo fading out.)

Aftermath

Victor Harlan’s Assassination: Two days after the interview aired, Victor Harlan was killed in his office under mysterious circumstances, later revealed to be orchestrated by the deep state.

Escalation on Mars: The crisis on Mars continued to worsen, with Harlan’s death serving as a temporary distraction from the growing unrest.

Shifting Leadership: Dr. Elias Cormack’s promotion to CEO of TerraGene marked a turning point, as he promised reforms to address the damage caused by his predecessor.
