### **Security Footage: Victor Harlan’s Office**  

*(The footage begins with Victor Harlan entering his lavish office. The room is lined with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the decaying cityscape. Luxurious furnishings and state-of-the-art technology dominate the space. Harlan appears calm, carrying a drink as he settles into his chair.)*  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(Murmuring to himself as he reviews documents on a holographic display)*  
"Another day saving the world—well, profiting from it, anyway."  

*(Suddenly, an armed gunman steps into the frame from the left, weapon raised. Harlan freezes but quickly composes himself, leaning back in his chair with a forced laugh.)*  

**Victor Harlan:**  
"Well, well. I have to admire your boldness, walking in here like that. Do you even know who I am? I assume you want money. How much is it going to take to make this little stunt disappear?"  

*(The gunman remains silent, his weapon trained steadily on Harlan. The CEO’s smirk falters slightly as seconds tick by with no response.)*  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(His tone sharpens, his confidence waning)*  
"You do know my office is equipped with the best security on the planet, don’t you? In a moment, you’ll be swarmed by guards, and this little charade will be over."  

*(The gunman takes a step forward. Harlan glances toward a hidden panic button beneath his desk and presses it. Nothing happens. The room remains eerily silent. His face tightens with fear.)*  

**Victor Harlan:**  
*(His voice lowers, almost a growl)*  
"You’re not just some rogue, are you? This is... this is a setup. Damn them. Damn them all. The deep state sent you, didn’t they?!"  

*(Harlan abruptly stands, spilling his drink, and bolts for a side exit. The gunman moves calmly after him, weapon raised. The footage ends as the camera shifts away, the sound of hurried footsteps and a single gunshot echoing before the feed cuts to black.)*

## **Meeting Transcript: Deep State Debrief**  
**Location:** Secure Deep State Facility  
**Date:** Following Harlan’s Death  

**Attendees:**  
- **Chairman Nora Vale**  
- **Admiral Leyton Vance**  
- **Dr. Elias Cormack** (Incoming CEO of TerraGene Industries)

**Chairman Vale:**  
"The Harlan problem has been resolved. Let’s focus on the aftermath. His... excesses had become a liability. His greed wasn’t just destabilizing TerraGene; it was becoming a public relations nightmare, and the timing couldn’t have been worse with the Mars population crisis spiraling out of control."  

**Admiral Vance:**  
"Still, taking him out in such a direct manner was a risk. The media will start asking questions, and the last thing we need is more instability on Earth or Mars. Do we have a cover story ready?"  

**Chairman Vale:**  
"Of course. Officially, Harlan was the victim of a botched corporate espionage attempt. His death will be framed as a tragic consequence of his own cutthroat dealings."  

**Dr. Elias Cormack:**  
"And what about TerraGene? I’ve been tasked with cleaning up his mess, but we can’t undo years of damage overnight. His policies gutted the ERI, diverted critical resources, and turned public sentiment against us."  

**Chairman Vale:**  
"That’s why you’re here, Dr. Cormack. Your reputation as a pragmatist and a reformer is precisely what TerraGene needs to regain credibility. Your job is to stabilize the company, reassure investors, and redirect public outrage away from us and toward Harlan’s legacy."  

**Dr. Cormack:**  
*(Nods)* "I’ll do what I can, but let’s not pretend Harlan acted alone. His abuses were enabled by this very table. We’re all complicit in the state of the world."  

**Admiral Vance:**  
"Careful, Cormack. You’ve been given a lifeline here. Don’t squander it by biting the hand that feeds."  

**Dr. Cormack:**  
*(Meeting the Admiral’s glare)* "I’m not biting anyone, Admiral. I’m simply stating the facts. If we’re serious about undoing the damage, we need to reevaluate our priorities, not just scapegoat Harlan and move on."  

**Chairman Vale:**  
"Your points are noted, Dr. Cormack. But remember your role—you’re the face of TerraGene now. Publicly, we expect compliance and optimism. Privately, do whatever it takes to steady the ship. Are we clear?"  

**Dr. Cormack:**  
*(Reluctantly)* "Crystal clear."  

**Chairman Vale:**  
"Good. Then we’ll consider this matter closed. Dismissed."  

*(Chairs scrape as the participants rise. The room empties, leaving Chairman Vale alone. She lingers for a moment, staring at a monitor displaying Harlan’s obituary, before turning off the screen.)*

## **Aftermath**  

### **Impact on TerraGene Industries**  
- **New Leadership**: Dr. Elias Cormack assumed the role of CEO, promising reforms and a renewed focus on TerraGene’s mission to support humanity’s survival.  
- **Public Perception**: Harlan’s death was portrayed as the result of corporate espionage, deflecting attention from deeper systemic issues.  
- **Internal Reforms**: While some efforts were made to redirect resources toward ecological recovery, much of Harlan’s legacy of corporate exploitation remained entrenched.  

### **Mars Crisis Distracted**  
The timing of Harlan’s assassination shifted public and governmental focus away from the escalating **Mars Peak Population Crisis**, buying the deep state valuable time to address the issue without widespread panic.

## **Legacy of Victor Harlan**  
Victor Harlan’s tenure as CEO became synonymous with greed, corruption, and excess. His death marked the end of an era for TerraGene, but the shadows of his actions lingered, shaping the company and the world long after his demise.
