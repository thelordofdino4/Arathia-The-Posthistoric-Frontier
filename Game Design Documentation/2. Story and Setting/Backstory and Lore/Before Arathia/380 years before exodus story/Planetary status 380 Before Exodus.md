380 Years Before Project Exodus

Earth’s population continues to plummet following The Great Decline, falling to approximately 2.1 billion. The planet is marred by resource wars, famine, and unrelenting ecological disasters. Urban centers become ghost towns, while surviving enclaves struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. Corporate control intensifies, with mega-corporations hoarding dwindling resources and exacerbating inequality.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 2.1 billion, concentrated in scattered enclaves.

Presence of Liquid Water: Critically endangered; fresh water sources remain scarce and heavily polluted.

Chemical Environment: Oceans are highly acidic, and atmospheric CO2 levels have reached critical levels.

Energy Sources: Limited; renewable energy struggles to meet demand as fossil fuels near depletion.

Physical Conditions: Extreme weather events intensify, leaving much of the planet uninhabitable.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 19.8%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.07% (critically elevated)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Nonexistent; frequent megastorms, droughts, and floods ravage the planet.

Radiation Protection: The ozone layer shows patchy depletion but remains partially intact.

Geophysical Stability: Local instability due to over-mining and resource extraction.

Ecosystem Support: Approximately 40% of species remain; ecosystems are fragmented and failing.

Economic Indicators: Extreme wealth concentration among corporate elites; widespread economic collapse.

Military Capabilities: National militaries persist but operate under corporate influence.

Geographical Factors: Deserts and wastelands expand, swallowing former arable land.

Demographics: Aging population; resource-driven displacement accelerates migration.

Technological Development: Advanced in resource extraction and AI; limited focus on ecological restoration.

International Relations: Fractured; resource conflicts dominate geopolitics.

Environmental Considerations: Little emphasis on sustainability; corporate interests prioritize short-term survival.

Magnetic Field: Stable and protective.

Geological Activity: Normal but exacerbated by human activities like over-mining.

Mars: Peak Population and Overcrowding
380 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars reaches its peak sustainable population of 4 million as its domed cities and underground settlements strain to support life. Terraforming efforts progress minimally, leaving the vast majority of the planet uninhabitable. Dependency on resources from the Asteroid Belt grows, fostering tensions with Earth and fueling calls for Martian independence.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 4 million; growth stagnates as migration slows.

Presence of Liquid Water: Limited to subsurface ice and small aquifers created by advanced extraction methods.

Chemical Environment: Predominantly CO2; domed environments maintain Earth-like conditions.

Energy Sources: Solar power and nuclear reactors operate near capacity.

Physical Conditions: Cramped living conditions within domes; outdoor survival requires full life-support systems.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially regulated within habitats; surface conditions remain hostile.

Radiation Protection: Shielding in domes and underground facilities proves effective.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; dust storms continue to disrupt surface activity.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farms and controlled biomes struggle to meet demand.

Economic Indicators: Dependency on Belt resources grows; limited local production capabilities.

Military Capabilities: Minimal; primarily focused on security and resource protection.

Geographical Factors: Expansion halts as habitable zones are fully utilized.

Demographics: Diverse but aging population; declining migration affects workforce sustainability.

Technological Development: Advanced in life-support systems and terraforming research.

International Relations: Increasingly tense relations with Earth; growing calls for Martian autonomy.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainability efforts intensify but remain constrained by resource limits.

Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; habitats rely entirely on artificial shielding.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring safety for settlements.

The Belt: A Growing Lifeline
380 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt continues to expand as humanity’s primary source of raw materials and water. Its population grows to 1.2 million, driven by economic opportunities and Earth’s worsening conditions. While life in the Belt remains harsh, innovations in mining and habitat construction improve living standards, solidifying the Belt’s role as a critical economic hub.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 1.2 million, with steady growth driven by migration.

Presence of Liquid Water: Harvested from asteroid ice; a reliable source for habitats and fuel production.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated within habitats; Earth-like conditions are standard.

Energy Sources: Solar power dominates; experimental fusion reactors show promise.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity and radiation exposure remain key challenges.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially maintained; habitats ensure consistent living conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding safeguards workers and residents.

Geophysical Stability: Carefully monitored to prevent structural risks from mining.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farms expand; food imports from Mars supplement diets.

Economic Indicators: Rapid growth; resources extracted are vital to Earth and Mars.

Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces expand to protect operations and infrastructure.

Geographical Factors: Stations cluster around resource-rich asteroids like Ceres and Vesta.

Demographics: Predominantly young workforce; rising number of permanent settlers.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge in mining, life-support, and orbital construction.

International Relations: Strained relations with Earth; calls for autonomy grow among Belters.

Environmental Considerations: Operations optimized for efficiency to avoid catastrophic failures.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety within habitats.

Geological Activity: Monitored to minimize risks during mining operations.
