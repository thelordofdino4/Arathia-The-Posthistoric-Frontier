**Jovian Ambitions: A Meeting Between Nora Vale and Dominic Orlan**  
*380 Years Before Project Exodus*

---

The quiet hum of the shuttle's engines was a welcome reprieve from the chaos Nora Vale had left behind on Earth. She gazed out the window at the distant glow of Jupiter, its swirling storms faintly visible even from this distance. The Jovian System was humanity’s next grand experiment—a bold attempt to establish permanent colonies beyond Mars and the Belt. It was a fragile hope, but one Nora had spent years advocating for, despite her growing disillusionment with the corporations driving the initiative.

Dominic Orlan, a rising figure in the Belt’s administration, sat across from her in the meeting room. The man was younger than Nora, but already showed the lines of someone worn by the hard decisions required to keep humanity alive in the void.

“Three colonies,” Dominic began, breaking the silence. “Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The Belt’s biggest expansion project yet. What do you think?”

Nora folded her hands, her expression carefully neutral. “I think it’s ambitious. Bold, even. But I wonder if it’s sustainable.”

Dominic raised an eyebrow. “You don’t sound convinced.”

### **The Challenges of Expansion**

Nora leaned back, her gaze sharp and penetrating. “The Belt’s resources are stretched thin as it is. Earth is crumbling under corporate greed, and Mars is barely holding on. Now we’re pouring resources into three new colonies? Europa with its icequakes, Ganymede with its unstable geology, and Callisto—”

“Callisto with its stability,” Dominic interrupted, a small smile tugging at his lips. “You have to admit, that one’s a safe bet.”

Nora allowed herself a faint smile. “Safe, maybe. But expensive. Every launch, every dome, every piece of equipment… it’s a gamble. And what happens if one of these colonies fails? How do you justify the loss to a population that’s already losing faith in the system?”

Dominic’s smile faded. “We’re doing this because we have no choice. Earth’s not coming back, Nora. Mars can’t hold everyone. The Belt isn’t enough. If we don’t push further out, humanity stagnates.”

Nora nodded, her gaze softening. “I know, Dominic. But pushing further out doesn’t mean we can forget what’s behind us. If we lose sight of Earth, if we abandon the fight to heal it, what does that say about us? About what we’re leaving behind?”

### **Jovian Promises**

Dominic sighed, running a hand through his hair. “You’re not wrong. But let me ask you this: do you really think Earth can be saved? Honestly?”

Nora hesitated, her hands tightening slightly. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “But I do know that if we stop trying, it’s over. Completely. And that’s not a choice I’m willing to make.”

The room fell silent, the weight of her words settling between them. Dominic studied her for a moment, his expression thoughtful.

“I’ll tell you what,” he said finally. “If these colonies get off the ground, I’ll do what I can to ensure they’re sustainable. Real sustainability, not just corporate PR. Biodomes, recycling systems, the works. And I’ll push for their profits to feed back into the Earth Reseeding Initiative.”

Nora’s eyes narrowed slightly. “You’re making promises you can’t guarantee, Dominic.”

He shrugged. “Maybe. But I’ve got more leverage in the Belt than you think. And besides, I believe in this, Nora. Just like you do.”

### **The Weight of Leadership**

Nora rose, walking to the window and staring out at the vastness of space. “The Belt’s leadership has been the only thing keeping the corporations in check,” she said quietly. “If you can make these colonies work, if you can set an example, maybe… just maybe, humanity can learn to build without destroying.”

Dominic joined her, the two standing side by side as the distant glow of Jupiter filled the window. “It’s not just about these colonies,” he said softly. “It’s about proving we can still work together. That we can do more than just survive. That we can thrive.”

Nora glanced at him, her expression softening. “Then don’t waste this opportunity, Dominic. Too much has been lost already. We can’t afford to lose hope.”

The shuttle’s engines rumbled as it prepared for docking, pulling them back to the reality of their mission. As they stepped off onto the Belt’s orbital station, the weight of their conversation lingered. The Jovian colonies were a gamble, but they were also a chance—a fragile hope for a humanity desperately in need of one.
