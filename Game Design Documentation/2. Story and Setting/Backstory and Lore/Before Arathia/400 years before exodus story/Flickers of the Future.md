# Flickers of the Future (Circa 400 YBE)

Dr. Luana Weiss stood on a makeshift gantry at the edge of Earth’s stratosphere, the metal platform swaying precariously in the gale-force winds. Far below, the battered planet stretched in shades of dust and ruin—evidence of a civilization on the brink. Yet here, atop a repurposed orbital launch tower, one slender hope gleamed in the form of **Horus III**, an unmanned sublight-warp hybrid prototype.

Over crackling loudspeakers, a voice counted down the moments until ignition. Technicians scrambled behind blast shields, reviewing the real-time feeds from data sensors. Less than a year ago, repeated warp-bubble experiments had ended in fireballs or collapsed fields. But a key breakthrough—precise power modulation synchronized by advanced AI—had recently allowed a warp bubble to remain stable for a few fleeting seconds.

## Stabilizing a Warp Bubble

“Warp integrity at eighty-five percent,” announced **Dr. Ingrid Viotto** from the observation bunker, scanning lines of readouts. Microsecond power pulses, coupled with an exotic negative-energy lattice, were projected to keep the warp field from collapsing immediately. A hush fell as the final countdown approached.

The Horus III sat on its launch cradle, half of its hull plated with insulating tiles for reentry, and the other half studded with superconducting warp coils. No pilot or passenger occupied its interior—only sophisticated AI, cameras, and sensor packages. If it survived the upcoming test, humanity would inch closer to mastering partial warp drive.

## Manned Sublight-Warp Hybrid Prototypes… Not Yet

The idea of a manned warp flight had been on every engineer’s lips months ago, but the catastrophic failures convinced them otherwise. With Earth’s environment disintegrating, there was no margin for losing more human lives in reckless trials. **Horus III** would be the pioneer, launching unmanned into low Earth orbit to test partial warp engagement. If the calculations held, it could briefly exceed the speed of light—only by a marginal percentage, but enough to prove that the principle was sound.

When the countdown reached zero, the fusion thrusters roared, lifting the craft away from the pad in a flurry of dust. Dr. Weiss and her team watched anxiously as Horus III vanished into the ashen sky. Minutes later, telemetry confirmed stable orbit. Then came the moment of truth: the warp coils charged, drawing power from compact antimatter-fusion cells.

## The Warp Field—and a Wrecked Return

In mission control, Dr. Viotto nearly stopped breathing as the warp field data spiked. For precisely three seconds, Horus III’s velocity indicators registered an impossible reading, suggesting it had slipped just beyond lightspeed by a scant percentage. Overjoyed shouts filled the bunker—until the warp field abruptly collapsed. Fault indicators flashed. Telemetry from the craft flickered, then cut out entirely.

Dread settled over the team. At best, Horus III might limp home. At worst, it had been destroyed. Two agonizing hours later, ground radar detected the craft reentering the atmosphere on emergency thrusters. Dr. Weiss and Dr. Viotto rushed to the charred landing zone, hearts pounding.

They found Horus III half-buried in the cracked earth, its hull rent open. Smoke curled from damaged thrusters. Yet the data recorders were intact—enough to show that, for those precious seconds, a warp bubble had indeed propelled the craft beyond light speed’s threshold. The resulting collapse battered it near to destruction, but it survived just enough to confirm partial warp success.

## Stealth Launches & Corporate Feuds

Even as Horus III lay wrecked under a smoldering sky, rumors swirled of rival labs launching their own unmanned warp probes. Some soared from hidden complexes in Siberia, others from coastal enclaves in West Africa, each seeking to claim credit for the first stable FTL leap. With Earth’s governments in tatters, no single authority could coordinate or regulate these efforts.

Sabotage was rampant. Reports trickled in of entire research facilities vanishing, either destroyed by unknown attackers or whisked off-world in secret. The partial success of Horus III only fueled this frenzy, as corporations and warlords angled to obtain the craft’s data. Dr. Weiss ordered additional security, knowing that an attack could come at any moment.

In the swirling dust of the landing field, Dr. Viotto clutched the battered flight recorder, relief mingling with heartbreak. “We’re so close,” she murmured, gaze flickering over the wounded vessel. “But it’s not safe yet. Not for a crew.”

Dr. Weiss nodded. “We’ll rebuild—and keep this quiet as long as we can. Until Earth is stable enough to handle the truth… or until we have no choice but to flee.”

A hush fell as the sun set behind choking clouds. Amid the apocalypse unfolding beyond their walls, the Horus III’s data whispered of a brighter, albeit distant, horizon. For a brief moment, an unmanned machine had flirted with the impossible. One day, perhaps, a human pilot might follow safely in its footsteps—but for now, that dream would have to wait.
