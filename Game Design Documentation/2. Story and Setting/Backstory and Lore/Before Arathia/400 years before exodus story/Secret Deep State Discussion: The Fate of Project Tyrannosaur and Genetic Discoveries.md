## **Transcript of Confidential Meeting**  
**Location:** Undisclosed United States Deep State Facility  
**Date:** 405 Years Before Project Exodus  
**Attendees:** High-ranking U.S. officials, corporate representatives, and senior scientists from Project Tyrannosaur

### **Opening Statements**

**Chairman Nora Vale:**  
"This meeting has been convened to address the latest findings from Project Tyrannosaur and determine their implications for the broader Earth Reseeding Initiative. While the results are undeniably groundbreaking, they also present challenges we can’t afford to ignore. Let’s remain focused and assess this situation pragmatically."

### **Project Updates**

**Dr. Elias Cormack (Lead Geneticist, Project Tyrannosaur):**  
"Thank you, Chairman. Over the past two years, we’ve successfully reconstructed viable genomes for several prehistoric species, including *Tyrannosaurus rex*, trilobites, and plesiosaurs. The AGI models have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, filling in fragmented sequences with predictive accuracy exceeding 99.7%."

*Dr. Cormack activates a display showing embryonic development models and genome reconstructions.*

**Dr. Cormack:**  
"We’ve not only confirmed the viability of these genomes but have also successfully developed embryos for certain species. While no further development was authorized, these findings validate the potential of the techniques pioneered in this project."

### **Concerns Raised**

**Admiral Leyton Vance (Defense Liaison):**  
"Dr. Cormack, I understand the scientific significance, but let’s talk practicalities. Viable embryos for *Tyrannosaurus rex*? You’re asking us to take on an enormous risk. How do you propose we secure such data when the global infrastructure is already fragile?"

**Dr. Cormack:**  
"Admiral, I agree the risk exists, but the embryos remain under strict containment. Additionally, the genome data is encrypted on internal systems. The real threat isn’t containment—it’s perception. If the public or other nations learn of these breakthroughs prematurely, it could destabilize an already volatile geopolitical landscape."

**Victor Harlan (Corporate Representative, TerraGene Industries):**  
"Not to mention the corporate fallout. If this goes public, every major player in biotech will want a piece of this. The economic potential is... significant, but the reputational damage would be equally severe if mishandled."

**Councilor Amina Revas (Ethics Advisor):**  
"And have we considered whether we should even *be* doing this? These species have been extinct for millions of years. Reconstructing them doesn’t just challenge ecological balance—it outright ignores it. Have we not learned enough from the mistakes of the ERI?"

### **The Debate**

**Chairman Vale:**  
"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. This meeting isn’t about whether the science should have been pursued—it’s about what we do now. Dr. Cormack, what’s your recommendation?"

**Dr. Cormack:**  
"Chairman, my recommendation is twofold: First, the genome data must be preserved, but under maximum security protocols. Second, we should encrypt the entire archive and store it off-world on dedicated satellites with self-destruct contingencies. This ensures the data remains intact but inaccessible without explicit authorization."

**Councilor Revas:**  
"And what happens if these satellites fall into the wrong hands? Encryption can be broken—if not now, then in decades or centuries."

**Dr. Cormack:**  
"The encryption algorithms are AGI-generated and adaptive. Unauthorized access would trigger a cascade deletion and physical self-destruction of the satellite. The risk of compromise is minimal compared to the value of preserving this data."

### **Risk and Value**

**Admiral Vance:**  
"Let’s not pretend this is risk-free. The potential for misuse is enormous, whether it’s rogue states or internal leaks. We’re putting this data into orbit and hoping future generations don’t misuse it. That’s a gamble."

**Victor Harlan:**  
"Admiral, respectfully, everything about space expansion is a gamble. The difference here is that we’re preserving knowledge that could define humanity’s ability to survive on Earth—or elsewhere. Terraforming efforts, ecosystem rehabilitation—this research will be foundational for all of it."

**Councilor Revas:**  
"Or it becomes a blueprint for disaster. We need to think long-term, not just about technological triumphs but also about the consequences of this power in the wrong hands."

---

### **The Decision**

**Chairman Vale:**  
"It’s clear that destroying this data would be shortsighted. The knowledge represents an irreplaceable resource, not just for humanity’s understanding of its past but for the potential to shape its future. However, the risks you’ve raised are valid, and security must be airtight."

*The room nods in agreement.*

**Chairman Vale:**  
"Dr. Cormack, you’re authorized to proceed with the satellite deployment. All genome data from Project Tyrannosaur will be encrypted, with self-destruct protocols embedded. Access will require unanimous approval from this council—or its successors. Additionally, no further species will be reconstructed without explicit authorization."

*Vale pauses, scanning the room.*

**Chairman Vale:**  
"Let me be clear: If this fails—if even one piece of this data is mishandled—the fallout will be catastrophic. We are not just preserving the past. We are defining the future. And the future must not know what happened here today."

---

### **Final Remarks**

**Chairman Vale:**  
"The official narrative remains unchanged. Project Tyrannosaur will continue as a scientific endeavor within the ERI framework, with no mention of its deeper capabilities. Publicly, we shelve this data only when deemed necessary for security. Meeting adjourned."

---

## **Outcome**

- **Encrypted Satellites Deployed**: All genome data from Project Tyrannosaur, including reconstructed species, was encrypted and stored on secure satellite networks with embedded failsafe measures.
- **Project Continuation**: Project Tyrannosaur remained operational but under strict oversight, with further reconstructions prohibited.
- **Official Narrative**: The deeper discoveries of Project Tyrannosaur were kept secret, with public understanding limited to surface-level findings.

This decision showcased the careful balance between preservation, security, and ethical restraint, marking a pivotal moment in the history of the Earth Reseeding Initiative.
