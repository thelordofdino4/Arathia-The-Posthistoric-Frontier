# The Great Collapse, Part III (Circa 400 YBE)

“Another settlement off the grid,” Emilia Kane remarked, studying her handheld survey device as she and her colleague stepped over a mound of cracked pavement. A swirling haze of ash and smog coated what had once been a bustling Baltic metropolis. Twisted high-rises loomed against a sickly gray sky—windows gone, walls scarred by decades of riots and neglect.

Emilia and Orion Parrish were part of the **Earth Survey Commission**, traveling as census takers and field observers. Their mission: document the fate of billions of people uprooted by climate disaster, resource wars, and mass migrations in the fifty years since the Geneva Summit of 450 YBE.

“This region’s population was in the millions before,” Orion said, running a quick atmospheric scan. “Now? We’ll be lucky to find a few thousand. The data doesn’t lie.”

They advanced through the hollow streets, using geolocators to trace abandoned infrastructure. Where large crowds once thrived, they now found only scavengers in tattered gear, sifting through rubble for anything worth trading. Stolen cables, bits of glass, salvageable wiring—all could be bartered for meager rations at the walled enclaves dotting the landscape.

A knot of armed scavengers trudged by. They paused only to glance at the bright Earth Survey emblems on Emilia and Orion’s equipment, then continued on, too weary to care. The exhaustion in their eyes was more haunting than fear could ever be.

“They look like ghosts,” Emilia murmured under her breath. “And these sensors—” She tapped the readouts on her device. “They show widespread contamination in the local water table. Another piece in a grim puzzle.”

Orion nodded. “We’ll log it. The Commission needs all the data we can gather. If there’s any chance of coordinating relief or resource allocation, it starts with an accurate picture.”

They navigated to the outskirts, where a once-celebrated library stood half-collapsed. Its sagging roof threatened to cave in entirely. Emilia’s breath caught at the sight of a broken marble façade, etched with the words _Humanitas Eruditio_.

Inside, shelves lay toppled in heaps, pages from ancient books drifting like dead leaves across the shattered floor. At the far end of the room, a single figure lurked behind a fallen column—a teenage girl with narrow, alert eyes.

Spotting their uniforms and handheld scanners, the girl straightened. “Surveyors, huh?” she said cautiously, words echoing in the dusty gloom. “We heard about you—the ones counting what’s left.”

Emilia approached slowly, hands raised to show no threat. “We gather numbers, stories, anything that helps us understand how people are surviving. If we can coordinate resources, maybe we can prevent worse disasters.”

The girl shrugged, revealing a makeshift sling around her arm. “Good luck. You can record me as ‘one more mouth to feed.’ Or maybe I’m ‘statistically negligible.’” A trace of bitterness clung to her voice.

Orion checked his survey device. “We’d prefer a name, if you’ll give it. And any news—how many folks are left here?”

She hesitated, gazing warily at the half-collapsed ceiling. “I’m Inga. And in this sector, there’s barely a couple hundred. Most starved after the water got foul. Others joined mercenary squads, or—worse.” Her glance flicked away. “Does your Commission actually help?”

Emilia frowned. “We document everything and pass it on to enclaves or relief agencies that can still mount assistance. Some enclaves have started shipping water purifiers—small scale, but it’s a start. If we don’t do this, no one will know the scale of the crisis.”

Inga gave a short laugh. “Everybody knows the scale—we once stood at over ten billion. Now maybe nine remain, if we’re lucky. That’s what people say.”

“We’re trying to verify,” Orion said softly. “We think the global number is even lower now, but real data is patchy. Our job is to gather truths, not rumors.”

Inga’s eyes flickered with some unspoken thought—hope, or maybe resignation. “Then hurry. We don’t have time for rumors.” She retreated into the debris before Emilia could reply.

Outside, thunder boomed, rattling the library’s battered frame. Glancing at the horizon, Orion and Emilia saw the shapes of stormclouds gathering. Though the battered city offered little shelter, they knew how important it was to finalize the day’s survey.

They walked the city blocks in methodical sweeps, scanning air toxicity, water contamination, and the number of residents they encountered. With each data point, the stark reality of Earth’s descent grew clearer.

“So many names, so many stories lost,” Emilia whispered when they reached the outskirts. “But at least we can document them. The Commission’s central archives might be the last real record of what happened… and who was left behind.”

Orion lifted his gaze to the sky’s dull glow. “If Earth’s leaders—whoever’s left—ever want to piece society back together, they’ll need to know how far we fell. Let’s make sure they have that chance.”

The pair continued onward, respirators humming in the ash-laden air. In the distance, the flicker of settlement lights hinted at life persisting, however fragile. For these two weary surveyors, each census entry marked one more hope that Earth’s story wouldn’t vanish in the swirling dust of its own ruin.
