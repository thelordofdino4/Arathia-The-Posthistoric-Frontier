Earth: Genetic Preservation Underway
400 Years Before Project Exodus

At this time, Earth remains habitable but continues to show visible signs of ecological decline. The Earth Reseeding Initiative (ERI) begins preserving genetic material in a bid to safeguard Earth's biodiversity, as environmental degradation accelerates. Global ecosystems remain under threat, but wildlife persists in dwindling numbers. Urban centers thrive under corporate governance, though inequality and unrest grow.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 9 billion.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable but increasingly strained; pollution and overuse threaten freshwater sources.

Chemical Environment: Oceans are moderately acidic; atmospheric CO2 levels rising due to continued industrial activity.

Energy Sources: A mix of fossil fuels, nuclear power, and limited renewable energy; corporate investment in solar arrays increases.

Physical Conditions: Temperatures rise steadily, leading to more frequent extreme weather events.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 20%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.05% (elevated levels contributing to global warming)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Declining; more regions experience droughts, floods, and storms.

Radiation Protection: Ozone layer remains intact but shows signs of depletion in specific regions.

Geophysical Stability: Relatively stable, though deforestation and over-mining exacerbate risks.

Ecosystem Support: Approximately 45% of species remain; ecosystems are under severe stress but functional.

Economic Indicators: Global inequality worsens; mega-corporations dominate economic activity.

Military Capabilities: Strong and well-funded national militaries still exist, though increasingly influenced by corporate interests.

Geographical Factors: Urban sprawl continues, while rural areas are neglected or industrialized.

Demographics: Growth slowing; increased urban migration and resource-driven displacement.

Technological Development: Advanced genomic preservation and interplanetary engineering; moderate progress in AI and renewable energy.

International Relations: Tensions grow over resource allocation; corporate lobbying undermines international cooperation.

Environmental Considerations: Reseeding projects represent humanity's primary ecological focus, though broader restoration efforts lag.

Magnetic Field: Stable and protective.

Geological Activity: Normal, though local disruptions increase due to human activity.

Mars: Early Expansion

Mars' domed settlements expand slowly as terraforming efforts continue. While reliance on Earth for resources persists, the colony achieves limited independence through advancements in local resource utilization. The success of the Earth Reseeding Initiative motivates similar preservation efforts on Mars.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 250,000; primarily scientists, engineers, and laborers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Progress in subsurface ice extraction supports limited aquifer creation.

Chemical Environment: Primarily CO2; domed zones sustain breathable atmospheres.

Energy Sources: Solar arrays and nuclear reactors power expanding settlements.

Physical Conditions: Harsh and cold; dust storms remain a constant hazard.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled within domes; terraforming shows slow but steady progress.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground habitats offer effective shielding.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; construction avoids high-risk zones.

Ecosystem Support: Small-scale hydroponics and biomes support the growing population.

Economic Indicators: Resource exports to Earth and the Belt drive modest growth.

Military Capabilities: Minimal; primarily security forces for resource protection.

Geographical Factors: Expansion focused on areas near water ice deposits.

Demographics: Skilled and educated workforce, with a rising population of second-generation Martians.

Technological Development: Progress in life-support systems and genetic engineering for crops.

International Relations: Dependent on Earth and the Belt; growing desire for greater autonomy.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainability efforts focus on minimizing habitat degradation.

Magnetic Field: Nonexistent; habitats rely on artificial shielding.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring stable construction zones.

The Belt: Establishing Infrastructure
400 Years Before Project Exodus

The Asteroid Belt's mining stations begin transitioning into semi-permanent settlements. Resource extraction supports Earth's struggling industries and Mars' expansion. Conditions remain harsh, but the Belt is increasingly vital to humanity's survival.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 150,000, consisting of miners, engineers, and administrators.

Presence of Liquid Water: Ice mining provides a stable water supply for habitats and fuel production.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated within habitats; Earth-like atmospheric conditions maintained.

Energy Sources: Solar energy remains dominant; nuclear reactors serve as backups.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity and radiation exposure necessitate rigorous health protocols.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially maintained; habitats offer consistent conditions.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding protects workers and equipment.

Geophysical Stability: Stable; mining operations monitored to prevent structural risks.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic farming expands; food imports from Earth remain crucial.

Economic Indicators: Rapid growth fueled by resource demand; wealth concentrated among corporate interests.

Military Capabilities: Corporate security forces maintain order and defend operations.

Geographical Factors: Infrastructure develops around resource-rich asteroids like Ceres and Psyche.

Demographics: Predominantly young and transient workforce, with limited permanent settlers.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge mining and life-support systems drive innovation.

International Relations: Tensions rise as Belters seek representation and autonomy from Earth corporations.

Environmental Considerations: Operations aim for efficiency to prevent catastrophic failures.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding ensures safety.

Geological Activity: Closely monitored to avoid risks during mining.
