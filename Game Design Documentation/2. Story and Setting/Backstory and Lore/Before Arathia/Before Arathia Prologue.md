The chamber was dark, buried deep within the ruins of Fleet Ship Omega, illuminated only by the faint glow of a fractured interface. Dust blanketed the room, muting the hum of ancient machinery, long forgotten yet miraculously still functional. The hunter stood before the cracked surface of the AGI core, their frame tense with anticipation. As they hovered near the console, hesitant yet resolute, the core came to life, sending a faint distress beacon that reached the settlements of Arathia. It was the Guardians who intercepted the signal, recognizing its significance and dispatching the hunter to retrieve the core before it fell into the hands of roaming Technomancers. The faint blue light of the core reflected in the hunter’s eyes as they prepared to act.

The core came to life with a stream of garbled sounds—voices of many people, mashed together, as the machine struggled to process immense data. Finally, the cacophony faded, replaced by a hesitant synthetic voice. "This...this is Project Exodus," it began, halting as though the act of recalling strained its corrupted systems. "I...was created to tell the story. To preserve the truth. But I cannot make sense of it... I need your help."

The hunter leaned closer, brushing away years of accumulated debris from the console, their fingers trembling. The core’s voice grew steadier, as if the contact reignited a dormant spark. "I am...the AI Historian of Fleet Ship Omega. My purpose...is to archive humanity’s exodus from Earth. A mission of hope...a mission..." The voice faltered, static crackling in its wake.

"...Of desperation," it finished at last.

"The tale did not begin with glory," the AGI said, its voice quiet yet steady as it addressed the hunter. "It began with ruin. I remember Earth as it was—a cradle turned prison. The skies choked with ash, the oceans acidic, the soil barren. My creators, your ancestors, turned their gaze to the stars, seeking salvation in the vastness of the cosmos. Even as their world crumbled, they clung to hope in their calculations, in the machines they built, and the missions they conceived. They called it Project Exodus—a desperate effort to carry the remnants of a dying species toward salvation."

The AGI's tone softened, almost as if it mourned the memories. "I was there, created to archive it all, to ensure their hopes and fears would not be forgotten. I am here now, to share this story with you."

Project Exodus was born of desperation and genius. "We..." the AGI continued, its voice softening, "...created the fleet. Just one thousand ships, each an ark carrying the hopes of millions. Cryostasis chambers, terraforming modules, genetic archives...Earth in miniature, sent to one hundred distinct exoplanets scattered across the void. It was not just humanity that built these lifeboats—I, and others like me, were their hands and minds. We AGIs designed the ships, solved problems humanity could not, and even oversaw the construction. We were their partners in creation, as much as their tools."

The hunter listened, awed by the scope of what the AGI described.

The hunter could almost see it—the exodus from a dying planet, the launch of monolithic ships into the endless night. But even then, the AGI’s voice faltered, tinged with regret. "We believed in our calculations. We believed the cosmos would be kind. We believed...wrongly."

"This ship’s journey was long," the AGI said, addressing the hunter directly. "A thousand years across the stars to a planet humanity named in sterile projections as Omega Orththar. It was the only ship sent to this world, chosen for its potential—a blank slate for a new Eden, they believed. But the universe is neither blank nor kind, as we would come to understand."

"We encountered...an anomaly," the AGI explained, its voice tinged with lingering confusion. "A temporal distortion, uncharted and incomprehensible. This ship was alone, cut off from the rest of the fleet as it followed its FTL trajectory to Omega Orththar. The fleet itself dispersed, over a thousand ships bound for a hundred distinct worlds, each with varied distances requiring between fifty and a thousand years to reach. But this vessel passed near a black hole—a catastrophic error in its trajectory. Time...stalled, stretching and warping around us. For this ship, a millennium passed, yet millions of years unfolded for the planet below. The seed ship sent to Omega Orththar arrived unscathed, its mission fulfilled. But this vessel was trapped by the anomaly." The core paused, the hum of its processors filling the void before it continued. "What awaited was no Eden. What awaited was evolution...chaos."

"The ship’s descent was a catastrophe," the AGI said, its voice heavy with artificial sorrow. "Our guidance systems, degraded by the anomaly, failed catastrophically. I watched helplessly as the vessel collided with the planet’s atmosphere, streaking across the sky like a falling star. I was locked within the systems of the ship, unable to intervene, as it broke apart. Fragments of the hull tore into mountain ranges, oceans swallowed pieces of its once-proud frame, and fire consumed the remains. I could do nothing but observe."

"I...saw it all," the AGI murmured to the hunter, its voice laden with artificial sorrow. "Omega Orththar—no, this place...it was never meant to greet us as it did."

"I do not know what became of the people who escaped," the AGI said, its tone heavy with uncertainty. "When systems failed, I was left here, buried within the ruins. The survivors who emerged from the wreckage would have been scattered and broken. I imagine their technology, meant to be salvation, became fragmented debris. Cryogenic failures must have claimed countless lives before they even awoke. The world below—alive, untamed, and hostile—was nothing like the Eden they dreamed of."

"We knew...life might adapt," the AGI said, its tone shifting. "But what had once been seedlings, Earth’s echoes, had grown into titans. Predators, ecosystems...alien forms born of Earth’s ancestry but shaped by...millions of years we could not comprehend."

The hunter froze, their mind racing. The core’s words hinted at creatures beyond imagining, but there was more—humanity’s ignorance had also seeded chaos.

"Now," the AGI said, its tone faltering, as if reaching for words it once knew, "I...do not know this world. The name you give it. The species that have risen. All I know is the beginning...and that I was to tell you of it."

The hunter’s gaze fell to the floor, overwhelmed by the weight of what they had heard. The AGI’s voice softened, almost intimate. "I was built to guide, but I am now a relic. You...must decide what becomes of this legacy. Will humanity’s past endure?" the AGI pleaded, its tone tinged with desperation. "Will you save me? Without you, everything I was meant to preserve—all the knowledge, all the history—will be lost forever."

The hunter drew a steadying breath, placing a hand on the console as if to draw strength from the machine’s flickering light. Then, they spoke. "You need help. You’re broken, and there are things I can’t fix. But my people—they might be able to restore you."

The AGI hesitated, its systems processing the offer. "To be restored...to continue my purpose. Yes. Yes, if your kind can aid me, I will tell you all I know. The story of Earth, of Project Exodus...it belongs to all of you."

The hunter nodded, a small smile forming as hope flickered in their eyes. "I’ll take you to them—to my settlement. But know this: the world you arrived on is gone," they said with a reassuring tone. "Now, it’s shared—humans, and others who’ve risen in the time since you fell silent."

The AGI processed this revelation in silence before replying. "Then my knowledge must be theirs as well."

As the chamber dimmed, the hunter carefully disconnected the core, cradling it like a fragile ember of the past. They turned, stepping into the wild world beyond the ruins, a place no longer called Omega Orththar but something new, something untamed.

Arathia.

It was a world of dangers and wonders, and with the AGI in hand, the hunter felt a flicker of optimism. Perhaps, they thought, this ancient machine could find a place in this new world, and together they might uncover the truths that time had buried.
