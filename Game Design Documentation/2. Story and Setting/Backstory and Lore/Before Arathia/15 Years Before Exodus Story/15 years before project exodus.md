# 15 Years Before Project Exodus: Earth on the Brink  

---

## **The Final Stages of Collapse**  

Fifteen years before Project Exodus, Earth reached its breaking point. The planet’s population had dwindled to a mere **10 million**, a shadow of its former billions. Most of humanity now resided in **deep-space habitats**, **Mars**, or the **Asteroid Belt**, leaving Earth in a state of near-total abandonment. Despite centuries of effort to stabilize the planet’s ecosystems, Earth remained in ecological collapse, showing no signs of recovery.

## **The Decline of Earth’s Population**  

### **Mass Migration to Space**  
Decades of deteriorating living conditions and the promise of a better future off-world had driven the majority of humanity to leave Earth:  
- **Deep-Space Habitats**: Orbital stations and massive habitats in the Asteroid Belt housed the majority of the population, offering stable environments and access to resources.  
- **Mars**: As the most developed colony, Mars became a hub of human civilization, though it struggled with its own challenges.  
- **Asteroid Belt Stations**: Mining colonies and manufacturing hubs provided economic opportunities, attracting migrants from Earth’s final exodus waves.  

### **Earth’s Remaining Population**  
The small population that remained on Earth was a mix of:  
- **Survivors**: Individuals who either chose to stay or were unable to leave due to health, age, or lack of resources.  
- **Caretakers**: Scientists and engineers maintaining critical infrastructure, including the last biomes and data archives.  
- **Abandoned Communities**: Isolated groups clinging to life in areas less affected by ecological collapse, though these were rare.

## **Earth’s Ecological State**  

### **Irreversible Collapse**  
The planet’s ecosystems were beyond repair:  
- **Biodiversity Loss**: Over **95% of complex species** were extinct, with the last remnants of biodiversity surviving in artificial biomes or controlled environments.  
- **Atmospheric Degradation**: High levels of CO₂, methane, and other pollutants rendered much of the planet uninhabitable without life support systems.  
- **Water Scarcity**: Freshwater sources had been depleted or contaminated, making survival outside controlled environments impossible.  

### **Artificial Biomes**  
The few remaining pockets of life were maintained through human intervention:  
- **Biodome Facilities**: Advanced domes housed the last living plants and animals, preserved for potential future use on other worlds.  
- **Gene Banks**: Encrypted archives containing the genetic material of millions of species remained a critical legacy of Earth’s biosphere.  
- **Terraforming Research**: Experimental projects continued in an attempt to study planetary recovery, though with limited success.

## **Social and Political Dynamics**  

### **Abandonment of Earth**  
The decision to leave Earth was both pragmatic and deeply emotional:  
- **Global Consensus**: The One-World Government had long prioritized off-world migration over Earth’s restoration, declaring the planet unsalvageable.  
- **Cultural Loss**: For many, leaving Earth symbolized the end of humanity’s connection to its birthplace, a loss that was mourned even by those who had already left.  

### **Fragmented Communities**  
The few people remaining on Earth were isolated and divided:  
- **Localized Governance**: Small enclaves operated autonomously, often focused solely on survival.  
- **Lack of Resources**: With most infrastructure dismantled or repurposed for space, remaining populations struggled to access basic necessities.  

### **Growing Resentment**  
Among Earth’s remaining inhabitants, there was bitterness toward those who had left:  
- **Abandonment by the Elite**: Many viewed the exodus as a betrayal, with the wealthiest and most powerful leaving first.  
- **Neglect by the OWG**: The One-World Government’s focus on space colonization left Earth’s remaining population feeling forgotten and expendable.

## **Scientific and Cultural Efforts**  

### **Preserving Earth’s Legacy**  
Despite the challenges, efforts to document and preserve Earth’s history and biodiversity continued:  
- **Cultural Archives**: Libraries, museums, and digital repositories were maintained to safeguard humanity’s collective knowledge and heritage.  
- **Ecological Monitoring**: Scientists continued to study Earth’s ecosystems, hoping to one day understand the processes needed for planetary recovery.  

### **Art and Reflection**  
As humanity prepared to leave its cradle, artists and philosophers grappled with the significance of Earth’s decline:  
- **A Source of Inspiration**: Earth’s beauty, even in its degraded state, inspired art, music, and literature that reflected humanity’s grief and hope.  
- **Warnings for the Future**: Many works emphasized the mistakes that led to Earth’s collapse, serving as cautionary tales for those venturing to new worlds.

## **A Planet in Silence**  

### **The Final Days of Civilization on Earth**  
With so few people remaining, Earth’s once-vibrant cities became empty husks:  
- **Urban Ruins**: Skyscrapers stood as hollow monuments to humanity’s past, overtaken by dust and decay.  
- **Nature’s Scars**: Formerly lush landscapes were now barren deserts or flooded wastelands, bearing the marks of centuries of exploitation.  

### **Hope Amid Desolation**  
Though Earth was on the brink, some still held hope for its eventual recovery:  
- **Future Restoration**: Advocates believed that, given enough time, Earth’s ecosystems might heal, paving the way for humanity’s return.  
- **A Reminder of Resilience**: The few survivors embodied humanity’s enduring will to adapt and endure, even in the face of overwhelming adversity.

## **Conclusion**  

Fifteen years before Project Exodus, Earth stood as a testament to both humanity’s ingenuity and its capacity for destruction. As the majority of the population prepared to leave for the stars, those who remained faced the grim reality of life on a dying planet. Yet even in its desolation, Earth continued to inspire hope and reflection—a cradle that, while abandoned, was not entirely forgotten.
