# The Year of Exodus: Humanity Leaves Earth  

---

## **The Dawn of a New Era**  

In the **Year of Exodus**, humanity embarked on its greatest journey—the departure from Earth to settle among the stars. The **Exodus Fleet**, comprised of 1,000 massive ships carrying the majority of the remaining population, launched toward distant star systems. This marked the culmination of decades of preparation, sacrifice, and hope, as Earth, now uninhabitable for the vast majority of life, was left behind.

## **The Final Departure**  

### **The Launch of the Exodus Fleet**  
- **Departure Sequence**: The Exodus Fleet launched in waves, each ship accelerating out of the solar system toward its assigned exoplanet destination.  
- **Population on Board**: Over **90% of humanity**—millions of people—departed, carrying with them Earth’s genetic legacy, cultural heritage, and the hopes of future generations.  
- **Destination Systems**: Each ship was programmed to reach one of over 100 identified planets, chosen for their Earth-like pre-industrial atmospheric conditions.  

### **Farewells from Earth**  
- **Last Departures**: The final evacuees boarded the Exodus Fleet in the weeks leading up to the launch, leaving behind a skeletal population of **13,000 people** scattered across the globe.  
- **Emotional Goodbyes**: For many, leaving Earth meant saying farewell to a planet that had shaped their entire identity, even as its environment became increasingly hostile.

## **Earth in the Aftermath**  

### **A Silent World**  
With the Exodus Fleet gone, Earth became eerily silent:  
- **Population Decline**: The remaining **13,000 survivors** were a mix of those unable or unwilling to leave. They inhabited isolated enclaves, subsisting in the ruins of humanity’s once-thriving civilizations.  
- **Decimation of Life**: The largest remaining terrestrial animals were no larger than house cats, with most larger species extinct due to habitat loss, pollution, and climate collapse.  

### **Ecosystem Collapse**  
Earth’s biosphere was reduced to fragments:  
- **Artificial Biomes**: A few biodomes and controlled environments remained operational, housing the last remnants of Earth’s biodiversity.  
- **Uninhabitable Landscapes**: Vast deserts, toxic oceans, and barren wastelands dominated the planet, making survival outside controlled environments nearly impossible.

## **Legacy of the Exodus Fleet**  

### **Carrying Earth’s Legacy**  
The Exodus Fleet was humanity’s greatest technological achievement, ensuring the survival of Earth’s legacy:  
- **Genetic Archives**: The ships carried genetic material from millions of Earth’s species, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, enabling the potential to recreate Earth-like ecosystems on new planets.  
- **Cultural Artifacts**: Libraries, museums, and digital archives preserved humanity’s history, art, and philosophies.  
- **Terraforming Tools**: Advanced technologies for altering planetary environments were included to support future colonies.  

### **Humanity’s Transition**  
The Exodus marked the final step in humanity’s transformation from a planetary to an interstellar species:  
- **Hope Amid Loss**: While Earth’s abandonment was mourned, the fleet symbolized a chance for renewal and survival in the stars.  
- **Unity and Division**: The fleet carried a united vision of humanity’s future but also reflected the inequalities and conflicts that had defined its past.

## **The Skeletal Population of Earth**  

### **Who Stayed Behind?**  
The 13,000 who remained on Earth represented a mix of individuals:  
- **Caretakers**: Scientists and engineers who maintained the last operational biodomes and genetic archives.  
- **The Resistant**: Those who refused to leave, driven by sentiment, belief, or distrust of the Exodus Fleet.  
- **The Left Behind**: Individuals unable to secure passage due to health, age, or lack of resources.  

### **A Struggle for Survival**  
Life on Earth became a desperate fight for survival:  
- **Isolation**: Communities were fragmented, relying on dwindling resources and improvised infrastructure.  
- **Declining Health**: Radiation, pollution, and a lack of medical care led to high mortality rates among the remaining population.

## **The End of an Era**  

The Year of Exodus marked the end of Earth as humanity’s home. As the **Exodus Fleet** disappeared into the depths of space, Earth was left in silence, a testament to both the resilience and fragility of life.  

### **The Promise of Return**  
For some aboard the fleet, there remained a faint hope that Earth might one day heal:  
- **A Sleeping Cradle**: Earth was seen as a wounded cradle, its future uncertain but not entirely lost.  
- **Generational Legacy**: The fleet’s passengers vowed to remember and honor the planet that had birthed them, carrying its story to the stars.

## **Conclusion**  

The Year of Exodus was humanity’s final chapter on Earth and the beginning of its story among the stars. While the planet was left in ruins, its legacy endured aboard the Exodus Fleet, ensuring that Earth’s memory and spirit would live on in humanity’s interstellar future.
