Corporate Panic: The Curse of the Seed Fleets
300 Years Before Project Exodus

The aftermath of the Seed Fleets’ launch was a moment of celebration for humanity—but within the shadowed boardrooms of Earth’s mega-corporations, it was a cause for panic. The sight of 100 ships streaking across the stars, carrying the genetic legacy of Earth, was a vision of hope for most. For the corporate elite, it was a symbol of failure.

They had lost.

Despite decades of subtle sabotage, regulatory barriers, and misinformation campaigns, Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel had advanced. Despite every effort to stall progress, Vanessa Marlowe and the visionaries who had picked up Elias Cormack’s mantle had succeeded in ensuring humanity’s first real step toward interstellar colonization.

Inside the high-rise towers of the corporate strongholds, frustration boiled over into fury. Meetings were held behind closed doors, guarded by layers of secrecy and fear. These were no longer discussions about competition or profits; they were desperate conversations about control, survival, and vengeance.

The Curse of Marlowe and Cormack

“They’ve doomed us all,” hissed Adrian Hale, CEO of Helios Industries, his voice dripping with venom. “Do you know what this means? We’ve lost the leash. Humanity is going to slip away into the void, and we’ll have no way to bring them back under control.”

Around the table, the other executives murmured their agreement. Vanessa Marlowe’s name was spoken with the kind of contempt reserved for traitors and revolutionaries. Elias Cormack’s legacy was invoked like a ghost haunting their ambitions, a man whose actions continued to thwart them even after his death.

“This was supposed to be contained,” said Emil Hark, director of Dominion Industries. “The stars were supposed to remain a distant dream. We controlled Earth. Mars. The Belt. But now? Now they’ve made it clear we’re no longer necessary.”

“They’re fools,” Hale snarled, slamming his fist against the table. “They think they can just scatter life into the void without consequences. We can’t let this stand. We can’t let them think they’ve won.”

A Dark Resolve

The room descended into silence as the weight of their predicament settled over them. The corporations had relied on humanity’s dependency for centuries—dependency on resources, infrastructure, and systems only they could provide. But now, with the Seed Fleets gone and FTL technology advancing, humanity’s trajectory had shifted. The future was no longer confined to the solar system.

“So what do we do?” asked Mireille Zhao of Ascendant Logistics, her voice trembling with unease.

Adrian Hale’s expression darkened, his tone cold. “We delay them. We’ve lost this battle, but we haven’t lost the war. If humanity is so desperate to follow those ships, we’ll make sure they’re not ready for it.”

“Delay them how?” Zhao pressed, leaning forward. “The technology is already out there. The framework for colonization vessels is in place. What’s left to sabotage?”

Hale’s smile was sharp, predatory. “Everything. We sabotage the FTL network. We create logistical bottlenecks. We infiltrate Terragene—find ways to make their systems ‘fail.’ And most importantly, we sow division. Let them turn on each other before they can turn their sights to the stars.”

The Plan Unfolds

The corporations began to lay the groundwork for their scheme, working in concert where necessary but always with an eye on their own interests. Economic manipulation became their first weapon. Helios Industries artificially inflated the cost of critical materials needed for FTL ship construction, choking supply lines under the guise of resource scarcity. Simultaneously, Dominion Industries orchestrated silent delays at key research facilities, infiltrating teams with operatives whose sole purpose was to sow discord and confusion.

Tensions rose as Ascendant Logistics funneled funds into opposition movements, stoking rivalries between Earth, Mars, and the Belt. Propaganda blanketed networks with grim projections of failed interstellar ventures, portraying colonization as a reckless gamble doomed to fail. Fear crept into public discourse, distracting humanity from its collective ambitions.

The conspirators knew they couldn’t stop FTL altogether, but they could slow it—turning humanity’s optimism into hesitation. Each delay, each bottleneck, was a calculated blow against the momentum of progress.

A Lone Voice of Resistance

Not every corporate leader joined the conspiracy. Vanessa Marlowe had her allies, and one of them—a former corporate insider—was privy to the growing shadow war. Owen Drexler, a defector from  Helios Industries, delivered a quiet warning to Terragene:

“They’re coming for you,” Drexler told Vanessa during a covert meeting. “They’re not just trying to stall progress. They want to destroy it. Permanently. You’re the only thing standing between them and total control of humanity’s future.”

Vanessa’s response was measured but resolute. “Let them try. We’ve faced worse.”

The Gathering Storm

The corporate machinations began to take effect. Delays and setbacks plagued FTL projects, resource shortages threatened the construction of colonization vessels, and political tensions flared across the solar system. Yet, even as the corporations worked to sabotage humanity’s future, there were those who continued to resist.

Vanessa Marlowe, undeterred by the growing opposition, stood as a beacon of hope and defiance. In secret meetings and public addresses, she rallied scientists, engineers, and visionaries to the cause. The Seed Fleets had launched, but the real battle for humanity’s future had only just begun.

A Legacy at Risk

In the end, the corporations’ efforts could not erase the Seed Fleets from history. The ships were already on their way, carrying the promise of life to distant worlds. But the question remained: would humanity be ready to follow?

As the conspiracies deepened and the struggle for control escalated, one truth became clear: the path to the stars would be paved with both hope and betrayal. And in the shadows, the legacy of Elias Cormack and Vanessa Marlowe hung in the balance, a fragile light in an ever-darkening universe.
