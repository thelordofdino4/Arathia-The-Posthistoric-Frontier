Earth: A Planet on the Brink
300 Years Before Project Exodus

By this time, Earth was a shadow of its former self, with its ecosystems nearing total collapse and its population reduced to isolated enclaves. The launch of the Seed Fleets provided a glimmer of hope, offering humanity the chance to preserve its legacy and expand beyond the confines of a dying planet.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 750 million, clustered in fortified urban zones and enclaves.

Presence of Liquid Water: Critically low; over 80% of surface freshwater sources depleted or polluted.

Chemical Environment: Toxic; widespread contamination of soil, air, and water persists.

Energy Sources: Dominated by nuclear and renewable technologies; limited fusion power emerging.

Physical Conditions: Extreme weather and desertification render most regions uninhabitable.

Atmospheric Composition:

Oxygen: 18.7%
Carbon Dioxide: 0.12% (exacerbating climate and biosphere collapse)
Nitrogen: 78%
Climate Stability: Virtually nonexistent; weather patterns chaotic and devastating.

Radiation Protection: Ozone layer fragmented, exposing equatorial zones to dangerous UV levels.

Geophysical Stability: Stable overall, though localized collapses from over-mining and deforestation increase.

Ecosystem Support: Fewer than 20% of species remain; most life exists in artificial biomes or genetic archives.

Economic Indicators: Localized economies dominated by corporate and enclave systems.

Military Capabilities: Fragmented but potent; localized factions and corporations maintain advanced arsenals.

Geographical Factors: Over 80% of the planet is uninhabitable; habitable zones reduced to temperate, coastal, and underground regions.

Demographics: Aging population; youth concentrated in off-world ventures or corporate enclaves.

Technological Development: Cutting-edge in AI and genetic preservation; rapid advancements in FTL applications.

International Relations: States reduced to symbolic governance; corporations and enclaves dominate.

Environmental Considerations: Preservation efforts focus on genetic material; rewilding abandoned for technological solutions.

Magnetic Field: Stable but irrelevant to survival efforts.

Geological Activity: Minimal, with localized risks due to human exploitation.

Mars: A Planet at Capacity
300 Years Before Project Exodus

Mars, with its population stabilizing at 6.5 million, focused on maintaining its existing infrastructure. Terraforming progress remained minimal, and its reliance on the Asteroid Belt for resources solidified its status as a support hub for humanity’s interstellar ambitions.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 6.5 million, with migration capped to avoid resource strain.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable but limited; aquifers and ice mining sustain the population.

Chemical Environment: CO2-dominated; breathable air confined to domes and underground habitats.

Energy Sources: Solar, nuclear, and early fusion power meet growing demands.

Physical Conditions: Habitable zones remain confined to domes; terraforming progress negligible.

Atmospheric Composition (Domed Zones):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially regulated; domes maintain stability while surface remains hostile.

Radiation Protection: Domes and underground habitats provide effective shielding.

Geophysical Stability: Stable, but dust storms disrupt logistics.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponic and synthetic ecosystems meet basic needs; imports from the Belt supplement supplies.

Economic Indicators: Steady growth tied to Belt trade and limited manufacturing.

Military Capabilities: Modest but efficient; designed for resource protection and internal stability.

Geographical Factors: Expansion focuses on strategic locations near resource-rich areas.

Demographics: Aging population, with increasing numbers of Martian-born settlers.

Technological Development: Advances in terraforming research and synthetic biology sustain the colony.

International Relations: Partnerships with Belt entities grow; ties with Earth weaken further.

Environmental Considerations: Sustainability efforts focus on existing domes rather than expansion.

Magnetic Field: Lacking; artificial shielding remains critical.

Geological Activity: Minimal, ensuring long-term stability for settlements.

The Belt: Humanity’s Lifeline
300 Years Before Project Exodus

The Belt became humanity’s industrial and economic powerhouse, supporting both Earth and Mars while preparing for interstellar missions. With over 15 million inhabitants, it represented humanity’s most efficient and innovative frontier.

Key Points:

Population: Approximately 15 million, with growing numbers of permanent settlers.

Presence of Liquid Water: Stable; ice mining supports the Belt and exports to other colonies.

Chemical Environment: Fully regulated in habitats; Earth-like conditions maintained.

Energy Sources: Solar power dominates; fusion power begins to emerge in high-demand areas.

Physical Conditions: Microgravity managed through advanced health protocols and infrastructure.

Atmospheric Composition (Habitats):

Oxygen: 21%
Nitrogen: 79%
Climate Stability: Artificially controlled; habitats optimized for comfort and productivity.

Radiation Protection: Advanced shielding ensures safety from cosmic radiation.

Geophysical Stability: Highly monitored to prevent mining-related collapses.

Ecosystem Support: Hydroponics meet local needs; imports from Earth and Mars continue.

Economic Indicators: Thriving; key supplier of resources and technology for interstellar missions.

Military Capabilities: Advanced corporate security forces rival traditional military powers.

Geographical Factors: Strategic expansion near resource-rich asteroids like Ceres and Psyche.

Demographics: Young and diverse population; growing cultural identity distinct from Earth and Mars.

Technological Development: Leading in mining, transport, and autonomous AI systems.

International Relations: Increasing autonomy from Earth; Belt entities form alliances with Mars.

Environmental Considerations: Efficient operations minimize ecological impact.

Magnetic Field: Artificial shielding integrated into habitats.

Geological Activity: Carefully managed to prevent mining accidents and ensure long-term stability.
