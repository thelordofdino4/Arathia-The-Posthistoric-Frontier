# The Fall of Bastion Avaris
_As recounted by Laurent Cavell, survivor of the Avaris Catastrophe._

I still wake to the sound of his roars, the ground trembling beneath my feet as the world burns. Bastion Avaris—what a name, what a folly. It was supposed to be humanity’s triumph, a jewel carved into the heart of Arathia’s untamed wilderness. A mansion built for visionaries, innovators, and the wealthiest pioneers, they called it. But to us who lived there, it was a gilded cage, suspended over a pit of monsters we barely understood.

Avaris was constructed with hubris as its foundation. Miles from any other settlement, it stood alone in the wilderness, its alabaster halls and towering spires rising defiantly against the forest canopy. The manor’s owners—industrialists, scientists, former aristocrats—all believed they were untouchable. They equipped the estate with every imaginable luxury and every conceivable defense. Automated systems, electrified barriers, reinforced walls—it was all meant to ensure safety in this wild, untamed world.

And yet, none of it could stop Maulcifer.

The first sign of his arrival was the low rumble, a vibration that ran through the earth like a pulse. We dismissed it at first—just another Arathian oddity, perhaps a minor quake or distant megafauna. But then came the sound, a roar so deep it seemed to claw its way through your chest. We rushed to the observation tower, peering into the darkness of the forest. At first, we saw nothing, only the faint rustle of treetops swaying. Then, like a nightmare emerging from the shadows, he appeared.

Two stories tall, black-scaled with hints of fiery red, his hulking form moved with unsettling grace. His horns glinted in the dim light, twin pairs arching like cruel crowns, and his gem-like eyes glowed with a cold, fiery malice. His wings were stunted compared to his massive frame, but they flared menacingly as he let out another roar, shaking the very air around him. We could only watch in paralyzed horror as he advanced, crushing trees beneath his claws and tail, his gait deliberate and unrelenting.

The mansion’s automated defenses kicked in. Electrified barriers hummed to life, and the sedative dispensers—designed to pacify and subdue any attacking creature—began to release their payload. These systems had been touted as infallible, the pinnacle of human ingenuity. The wealthy inhabitants of Avaris had been so confident, so certain, that no creature could breach their fortress.

But Maulcifer was no ordinary creature. He tore through the electrified barriers as if they were twigs. The sedative slowed him, but only slightly. His roars grew more furious, his movements more erratic as he fought the effects. We watched in horror as he charged the main gate, his sheer mass splintering it into fragments. The alarms screamed through the halls as the residents scrambled, their confidence shattered in an instant.

I remember running through the grand corridors, past priceless artwork and opulent furnishings that now felt obscene in their futility. Maulcifer’s claws tore through walls with ease, his fire breath turning the once-pristine marble to charred ruin. He moved with terrifying speed, leaping between hallways in his four-legged stance, his horns smashing through archways as he sought his prey.

The owners of the manor—the “visionaries” who had built this monument to their arrogance—fared no better than the rest of us. Lady Vostova, one of the estate’s wealthiest patrons, tried to reason with the beast, her voice trembling as she shouted into the chaos. Maulcifer responded with a roar that silenced her forever. Others attempted to flee in the estate’s emergency escape vehicles—hovercraft designed for short-range flight—but the beast’s fire reduced many to ash before they could even lift off.

At one point, I ducked into a side room—a library, I think—just as Maulcifer’s claws raked through the wall, inches from where I had stood. His snout pressed against the broken wall, his nostrils flaring as he sniffed for prey. I held my breath, heart pounding, until he moved on, his heavy steps echoing down the corridor.

The sedative dispensers continued their work, and gradually, Maulcifer’s movements slowed. His fire breath became less frequent, his roars more labored. But by then, it was too late. The mansion was in ruins, its inhabitants either dead or fleeing into the wilderness. The technology they had so carefully guarded—the systems designed to aid humanity’s expansion into Arathia—now lay buried beneath the rubble, inaccessible to those who might have used it for good.

I escaped only by sheer luck, slipping through a side passage as Maulcifer tore through the main atrium. I remember looking back, seeing him rear onto his hind legs, his gem-like eyes scanning the burning halls. He let out a final roar, one that seemed to shake the heavens, before collapsing onto all fours. The sedatives had finally taken hold, but the damage was done. Bastion Avaris was no more.

For years, Maulcifer has remained within the ruins, a self-declared lord of the manor. Hunters speak of his lair as a place of nightmares, where his roars still echo through the shattered halls. The technology hidden within is said to be invaluable—systems that could revolutionize human settlements on Arathia. But retrieving it would mean facing Maulcifer, a challenge few are willing to accept.

As for me, I carry the weight of that night like a stone in my chest. I think of the hubris that built Bastion Avaris, the arrogance that led us to believe we could tame a world like Arathia. I think of Maulcifer, his burning eyes filled with fury and defiance. And I think of Lady Vostova’s final words, shouted into the chaos: “This is our home!”

No, I think. It never was.

It was always his.
