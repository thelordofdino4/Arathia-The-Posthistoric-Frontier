Humanity's Struggles Before Project Exodus (Chronologically Ordered Timeline)


---

450 Years Before Exodus: The Colonization of Mars

Humanity establishes its first permanent colony on Mars. Initial settlements focus on mining and research under domed habitats.

Terraforming efforts begin but progress is slow; only small portions of the planet are habitable.



---

420 Years Before Exodus: Asteroid Belt Expansion

Humanity constructs the first space stations in the asteroid belt to mine water ice and minerals critical to Mars and Earth’s survival.

These stations grow into semi-permanent settlements but remain heavily reliant on Earth’s logistical support.



---

400 Years Before Exodus: Genetic Preservation

The Earth Reseeding Initiative is completed, cataloging and preserving the DNA of Earth's biodiversity. It becomes the most comprehensive genetic archive in history.

Within 10 years, scientists declare it’s too late to implement the project. Earth's ecosystems are too degraded, and reseeding is postponed until the planet achieves homeostasis.



---

390 Years Before Exodus: Population Collapse

Earth’s population drops to 2.4 billion due to famine, ecological disasters, and widespread conflict over dwindling resources.

Cities become uninhabitable, and rural areas shrink as natural disasters increase in frequency and intensity.



---

380 Years Before Exodus: Mars Reaches Peak Population

Mars achieves its maximum sustainable population under existing technologies. Only 5% of the planet is habitable, and the colony remains dependent on resources from the asteroid belt.

Migration slows, and Mars’ population begins to stagnate.



---

375 Years Before Exodus: Colonization of Jupiter’s Moons

Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are colonized, but most settlements fail due to extreme environmental conditions. Only a few research stations remain operational.



---

350 Years Before Exodus: FTL Travel Invented

Humanity achieves Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel, enabling interstellar exploration. Surveys identify over 100 exoplanets with pre-industrial Earth-like conditions.

Earth’s population shrinks to 900 million, but only 14% have migrated to space since the population peak of 2.4 billion.



---

320 Years Before Exodus: The Sixth Extinction

Over 95% of complex multicellular species are extinct. Isolated populations survive in artificial biomes or refuges, but Earth's ecosystems are irreparably damaged.



---

300 Years Before Exodus: The Seed Fleets

Humanity launches 100 autonomous Seed Fleets, loaded with embryos, genetic material, and terraforming tools. These fleets prepare distant exoplanets for eventual human colonization.



---

275 Years Before Exodus: Mars Population Collapse

Mars’ population suffers a steep decline due to aging demographics, low birth rates, and limited technological progress.

Terraforming improves habitability to 5%, but this isn’t enough to sustain long-term growth.



---

250 Years Before Exodus: The Great Evacuation

Orbital stations are relocated closer to Earth to evacuate as many people as possible. Earth's population falls to 500 million.

Space habitats and Mars remain the primary destinations for evacuees.



---

200 Years Before Exodus: The Death of Nations

The last sovereign nations collapse under financial and social strain. They are absorbed into mega-corporations that dominate Earth’s surface and resources.

Corporations prioritize profits over humanity’s survival, exacerbating Earth’s decline.



---

150 Years Before Exodus: Mars Expands

Mars achieves 20% habitability thanks to resources from the asteroid belt. Its population stabilizes temporarily before resuming its decline.



---

125 Years Before Exodus: Venus Colonization Attempt

Humanity makes an effort to colonize Venus but quickly abandons the project due to unmanageable atmospheric conditions.

Scientists estimate Venus won’t be viable for another 100 years of technological development.



---

100 Years Before Exodus: The Fall of Corporations and Rise of the One-World Government

Corporate Collapse: Mega-corporations crumble under inefficiency, infighting, and resource shortages. Public uprisings and societal collapse leave Earth in chaos.

One-World Government Rises: A global authoritarian regime forms, replacing corporate rule. It focuses on stabilizing Earth’s population, resources, and ecology in preparation for humanity’s migration to the stars.



---

95 Years Before Exodus: Project Exodus Begins

The One-World Government approves Project Exodus as humanity’s last hope for survival. Construction of 1,000 Exodus fleet ships begins in the asteroid belt.



---

90 Years Before Exodus: Exodus Fleet Construction

Space stations in the asteroid belt serve as hubs for building the Exodus fleet ships, which are designed to sustain human life for long interstellar journeys.



---

15 Years Before Exodus: Earth on the Brink

Earth’s population shrinks to 10 million, with most of humanity now living in deep-space habitats, Mars, or asteroid belt stations.

Earth remains in ecological collapse, showing no signs of recovery.



---

5 Years Before Exodus: Exodus Fleet Ready

The 1,000 Exodus fleet ships are completed and begin loading passengers from Mars, Jupiter’s moons, and deep-space habitats.



---

1 Year Before Exodus: The Final Address

Earth’s last president delivers a poignant farewell speech, urging the remaining population to leave for humanity’s survival. He acknowledges that Earth can no longer support human life.

Earth’s population drops to 20,000.



---

The Year of Exodus

The Exodus fleet ships launch, carrying the majority of humanity to distant star systems. Earth is left with a skeletal population of 13,000 survivors.

The largest remaining terrestrial animals are no larger than house cats.



---

Post-Exodus: Earth in Silence

200 Years After Exodus

Only 350 humans remain on Earth, living in scattered underground shelters. Radiation levels remain high, and ecological recovery is minimal.



---

700 Years After Exodus

The last human on Earth dies from radiation poisoning and malnutrition. Earth becomes a silent world, waiting for the eventual reseeding of life.

Humanity continues to thrive in space, rebuilding its civilization and awaiting Earth’s recovery.
