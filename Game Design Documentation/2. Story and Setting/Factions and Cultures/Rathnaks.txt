Faction: The Frostveil Enclave
Detailed Description of the Frostveil Enclave
Appearance:

Size: The Rathnaks are diminutive, smaller than the Ferloth, typically standing less than a foot tall.
Fur: They have sleek, frost-colored fur that helps them blend seamlessly into their icy surroundings.
Clothing: Rathnaks often hide their bodies in clothes camouflaged to their environment, be it snow-covered terrain or the earth they dig through. These clothes provide additional concealment and protection from the harsh elements.
Behavior and Culture:

Paranoia and Fear: The Rathnaks’ culture is dominated by paranoia and fear. They view everything that is not a Rathnak as a threat, from the smallest insect to the largest monster.
Trap Masters: Males meticulously set up trap fields around a central hub where the females and children live. These trap fields are designed to keep intruders out and protect their community.
Oral Tradition: Their oral tradition is centered on instilling fear. Stories passed down through generations emphasize the dangers of the world and the need for constant vigilance.
Subconscious Enjoyment: It is hypothesized by other species that the Rathnaks may subconsciously enjoy their paranoia and meticulous planning, as it provides them with a sense of control and purpose.
Habitat:

Icy Tundras: The Frostveil Enclave inhabits the frozen regions of Arathia, far from the more temperate and populous zones.
Central Hubs: Their homes are deep within the ice and snow, protected by extensive trap fields. These central hubs are where females and children reside, surrounded by a labyrinth of defenses.
Technology and Abilities:

Traps and Tricks: The Rathnaks are experts in creating and deploying traps. Their lairs are filled with hidden dangers for any would-be intruders.
Crystal Traps: Unique traps that do increased damage to the native animals of Arathia. These traps are hidden underground and activated to immobilize and harm monsters.
Stealth and Evasion: Seeing a Rathnak is nearly impossible unless they wish to be seen. They excel in stealth, using their small size and nocturnal habits to their advantage.
Underground Tunnels: The Rathnaks have an extensive network of underground tunnels, allowing them to move undetected and set up traps around their territory.
Interaction with the Player:

Diplomatic Goals: The protagonist's goal is to show the Rathnaks that other races mean them no harm, fostering trust and understanding. This is complicated by the central conflict involving the destruction of Ferloth settlements due to Rathnak paranoia. The Ferloth are unaware the Rathnak even exists, and blame it on "angry snow fairies."
Non-Recruitable: While players cannot recruit Rathnaks, they can encounter them in the tundra regions.
Potential Allies: If the player is spotted fighting a monster in the tundra, the Rathnaks may assist by using their network of underground tunnels to lay traps for the monster.

Surprise Attacks: They can lay traps and spring them at the opportune moment, catching the monster off guard.
