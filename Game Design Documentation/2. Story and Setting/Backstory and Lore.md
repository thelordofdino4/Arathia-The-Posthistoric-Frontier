## Human Arrival and Initial Colonization

### Discovery and Seeding
- **Humanity's Last Hope:** Earth faced ecological collapse due to overpopulation, climate change, and resource depletion. In a desperate bid to ensure the survival of humanity, a coalition of scientists, engineers, and visionaries developed a plan to colonize distant planets.
  - **Failed Attempts in the Solar System:** Initially, humans attempted to colonize planets and moons within the solar system, such as Mars and Titan. However, these efforts faced insurmountable challenges:
    - **Mars:** Despite significant investment and technological advancements, Mars proved too harsh for sustainable human life. The thin atmosphere, high radiation levels, and lack of liquid water sources made long-term habitation unfeasible.
    - **Titan:** Titan, one of Saturn's moons, was considered due to its thick atmosphere and potential resources. However, the extreme cold, low gravity, and difficulty in accessing necessary materials for building infrastructure made it an impractical choice.
    - **Space Stations:** Large space habitats were also constructed, but they faced limitations in terms of resources, space, and the psychological effects of living in an artificial environment.
  - **The Need to Leave the Solar System:** Realizing the limitations and challenges of colonizing within the solar system, humanity turned its gaze to the stars. The hope was to find an Earth-like planet where life could flourish naturally without the extreme modifications needed for Mars, Titan, or space stations.
- **Arathia's Potential:** Arathia was discovered as a potentially habitable planet with conditions similar to prehistoric Earth. Believing it to be devoid of life, humanity sent automated terraforming ships to prepare the planet for future colonists.
  - **Natural Resources:** Unlike Mars or Titan, Arathia was rich in natural resources, including abundant water, fertile soil, and diverse minerals. These resources promised a sustainable environment where humans could thrive without relying on artificial habitats.
  - **Earth-Like Conditions:** Arathia's climate and atmosphere were similar to those of prehistoric Earth, offering a more familiar and manageable environment for human settlers. This reduced the need for extensive terraforming and environmental control systems.
  - **Human-Engineered Biodiversity:** The seeding process included the introduction of Earth life forms—plants, insects, and small animals—intended to create a sustainable ecosystem that would be ready for human arrival. The expected biodiversity was a result of these deliberate actions, aiming to create a balanced and self-sustaining environment.
  - **Psychological Well-being:** Living on a planet with vast open spaces, natural landscapes, and a variety of life forms was believed to offer significant psychological benefits compared to the confined and artificial environments of space stations and other planets in the solar system.
  - **Long-Term Survival:** The ability to establish a colony on a planet with Earth-like conditions was seen as a more viable long-term survival strategy. It provided the opportunity to rebuild human civilization in a natural setting, preserving cultural and social structures.
### Seeding the Planet
- **Initial Process:** The terraforming and seeding of Arathia were multi-phased operations, carefully planned to ensure the creation of a sustainable ecosystem. Automated ships were sent to prepare the planet for human colonization.
