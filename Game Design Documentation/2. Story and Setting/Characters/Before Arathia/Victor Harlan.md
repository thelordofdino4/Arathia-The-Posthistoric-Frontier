  - *In a heated boardroom confrontation with Dr. Eleanor Vesari, he dismissed accusations that TerraGene’s funding was diverting resources away from the Earth Reseeding Initiative (ERI), defending his actions as pure business.*  
  - *In private conversations between deep state figures Nora Vale and Admiral Leyton Vance, Harlan is denounced as a “cancer” whose corporate excesses deepened the planet’s decline.*  
  - *His final public interview on the Mars crisis painted Mars as “evolving” despite mounting evidence of collapse—a stance that further fueled public outrage.*  
  - *Ultimately, his downfall was sealed when security footage captured an assassination in his lavish office, followed by deep state debriefs that confirmed his removal was orchestrated to stem further destabilization.*

## 5. Motivations & Goals

- **Long-term Aspirations:**  
  *To build a lasting corporate legacy that would ensure TerraGene’s—and by extension, his own—place in history, even if it meant sacrificing the core ideals of projects like the ERI.*
- **Internal Conflicts:**  
  *Despite his outward arrogance, private exchanges reveal hints of inner turmoil. Faced with mounting evidence of his role in misdirecting crucial funds and resources, there are fleeting moments when he appears to recognize the moral void in his actions—even though he ultimately clings to his profit-driven worldview.*

- **Character Arc:**
